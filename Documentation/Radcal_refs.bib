abstract = {Radiation within a medium containing products of combustion is dependent upon the temperature and concentrations throughout the entire field. The energy is distributed across the infrared spectrum in a highly nonlinear fashion, which greatly complicates modeling of the heat transfer within a burning environment. This report describes a numerical program, RADCAL, which predicts the radiant intensity leaving a nonisothermal volume containing nonuniform levels of carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and soot. The absorption coefficient of the combined gases is calculated from a narrow-band model and a combination of tabulated spectral properties and theoretical approximations to the vibrational-rotational molecular bands. Soot is treated as a purely absorbing substance in the Rayleigh limit. Background on the development of the model, example calculations, and an explanation of input procedures are presented.},

	Abstract = {In large-scale fires, the input of energy to burning materials occurs predominantly by radiative transfer. The in-depth (rather than just surface) absorption of radiant energy by a polymer influences its ignition time and burning rate. The present investigation examines two methods for obtaining the absorption coefficient of polymers for infrared radiation from high-temperature sources: a broadband method and a spectral method. Data on the total average broadband transmittance for 11 thermoplastics are presented (as are reflectance data), and the absorption coefficient is found to vary with thickness. Implications for modeling of mass loss experiments are discussed. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Fires and especially pool fires are among the most frequent accidents in process facilities. Flame impingement and thermal radiation are the main hazardous characteristics of pool fires. Pool fires have been the subject of numerous modeling and experimental studies covering a variety of areas such as fire and flame structure, emissive power, temperature distribution and fire characteristics. The effects of environmental parameters such as wind velocity, humidity and water/ice droplets in the air have not been studied extensively. Further, the effect of surrounding surface reflectivity has not been studied. This issue is very important for cold regions like the Arctic, where outdoor surfaces are covered with snow and ice for several months of the year. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive fire consequence modeling tool that includes pool fire development, environmental characteristics effects and thermal radiation. This study proposes a new comprehensive model for steady state and fully developed pool fires. This new model takes into account the effects of environmental variables such as temperature, the presence of droplets and surface reflectivity on thermal radiation and subsequently on the fire consequence assessment.

	Abstract = {Fuel vapors, soot and products of combustion near a burning fuel surface often block much of the radiative heat feedback to the fuel surface of a burning object. The blockage phenomenon was clearly observed in experiments of small 9.5 cm diameter PMMA pool fires subjected to external radiation burning in ambient atmospheres of different oxygen concentrations. The measurements are explained by a one-dimensional model of a diffusion flame, which focuses on the radiant absorption and emission of the soot-gas mixture of the flame. An approximate Band Model was developed and inserted into Radcal to compute gas absorption and emission from MMA vapor, CO2 and H2O. The Radcal results are included in the one-dimensional diffusion flame model to provide a greater understanding of the radiation blockage and burning rates in various ambient atmospheres and externally imposed radiant heat fluxes. A comparison between experimental data and model prediction shows a good agreement. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Decoupled radiative heat transfer calculations of 30 cm-diameter toluene and heptane pool fires are performed employing the discrete ordinates method. The composition and temperature fields within the fires are created from detailed experimental measurements of soot volume fractions based on absorption and emission, temperature statistics and correlations found in the literature. The measured temperature variance data is utilized to compute the temperature self-correlation term for turbulence-radiation interactions. In the toluene pool fire, the presence of cold soot near the fuel surface is found to suppress the average radiation feedback to the pool surface by 27%. The performances of gray and three non-gray radiative property models for the gases are also compared. The average variations in radiative transfer predictions due to differences in the spectroscopic and experimental databases employed in the property model formulations are found to be between 10% and 20%. Clear differences between the gray and non-gray modeling strategies are seen when the mean beam length is computed based on traditionally employed geometric relations. Therefore, a correction to the mean beam length is proposed to improve the agreement between gray and non-gray modeling in simulations of open pool fires. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {It has occasionally been observed that fires in tunnels appear to be significantly more severe than fires in the open air. A literature review has been carried out, comparing heat release data from fires in tunnels with heat release data from similar fires in the open air. A Bayesian methodology has been used to investigate the geometrical factors that have the greatest influence on heat release rate. It is shown that the heat release rate of a fire in a tunnel is influenced primarily by the width of a tunnel; a fire will tend to have a higher heat release rate in a narrow tunnel rather than in a wide tunnel. The observed relationship between heat release rate and tunnel width is presented. Results from a study investigating the variation of heat release rate with ventilation velocity for fires in tunnels are also presented. A method for making realistic estimates of the heat release rates of fires in tunnels, based on these results, is presented.},

	Abstract = {In recent years Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been the dominant technique used for measuring the infrared (IR) absorption and emission spectra of most materials, with substantial advantages in signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, speed, and detection limits. The major advantage of the FIFIR technique over other spectroscopic methods is that practically all compounds show characteristic absorption/emission in the IR spectral region and based on this property they can thus be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quest for highly sensitive detection methods for atmospheric trace gas samples, either in laboratory setup or in outdoor remote sensing, has been on agenda for several decades. The fast and intensive development of FTIR spectroscopic techniques has propelled the progress of trace gas analysis of the atmosphere. Since the early 1970s the number and scope of FTIR atmospheric measurements has increased steadily. In this review article we are making an attempt to summarize the results of the most significant contributions to the field of FTIR spectroscopy to trace gas analysis of the atmosphere. Beside the basic description of the extractive and open-path measurement methods, the difficulties connected with collection of appropriate background reference spectra, the ways of qualitative analysis and quantitative evaluation of measured spectra, the problems of calibration, and the effects of spectral resolution on detection sensitivity are discussed. The techniques reviewed include in situ IR absorption measurements over open paths in the field, such as remote sensing using the sun, the sky, or natural hot objects as IR sources of radiation, and also IR emission measurements of hot trace gas sources e.g., stack emissions, exhaust gases of combustion sources, and other industrial effluents.},

In comparison with the previous two-dimensional simulation results, the three-dimensional LES results for the helium plume show much better agreement with the available experimental data. A relatively simple combustion model involving Lagrangian thermal elements with a single empirical constant involving the time to burn out of notional fuel parcels was adequate for obtaining reasonable predictions of the mean velocity and vorticity fields. The model also captured the temperature distribution patterns in the methane/air diffusion flames reasonably well.

	Abstract = {The burning rate of a slick of oil on a water bed is characterized by three distinct processes, ignition, flame spread and burning rate. Although all three processes are important, ignition and burning rate are critical. The former, because it defines the potential to burn and the latter because of the inherent possibility of boilover. Burning rate is calculated by a simple expression derived from a one-dimensional heat conduction equation. Heat feedback from the flame to the surface is assumed to be a constant fraction of the total energy released by the combustion reaction. The constant fraction Q) is named the burning efficiency and represents an important tool in assessing the potential of in situ burning as a counter-measure to an oil spill. By matching the characteristic thermal penetration length scale for the fuel/water system and an equivalent single layer system, a combined thermal diffusivity can be calculated and used to obtain an analytical solution for the burning rate. Theoretical expressions were correlated with crude oil and heating oil, for a number of pool diameters and initial fuel layer thickness. Experiments were also conducted with emulsified and weathered crude oil. The simple analytical expression describes well the effects of pool diameter and initial fuel layer thickness permitting a better observation of the effects of weathering, emulsification and net heat feedback to the fuel surface. Experiments showed that only a small fraction of the heat released by the flame is retained by the fuel layer and water bed (of the order of 1%). Ignition has been studied to provide a tool that will serve to assess a fuels ease to ignite under conditions that are representative of oil spills. Two different techniques are used, piloted ignition when the fuel is exposed to a radiant heat flux and flash point as measured by the ASTM D56 Tag Closed Cup Test. Two different crude oils were used for these experiments, ANS and Cook Inlet. Crude oils were tested in their natural state and at different levels of weathering, showing that piloted ignition and flash point are strong functions of weathering level. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The fast and accurate determination of oxygen in air is important for fire research. Available O-2 sensors (paramagnetic, electrochemical, ZrO2) are only of limited use because of significant errors caused by the specific sampling or measurement process, so that a purely optical, in situ detection is of great interest. Optical methods can account for the dilution of O-2 by water (both vapor and drops) and are thus valuable tools for studying the effectiveness of water for replacing halogenated fire suppressants. To fulfill this need, a tunable diode laser based absorption spectrometer (TDLAS) has been developed for the in situ detection of molecular oxygen at 760 nm (A band, b(1)Sigma(g)(+)<--X(3)Sigma(g)(-)). The device was successfully tested during full-scale fire-suppression tests carried out at the Naval Research Laboratory Chesapeake Bay Detachment facility in a 28-m(3) test Compartment. A specially protected open-path Herriott multipass setup with an absorption length of 1.8 m was developed to restrict the probe volume to a base length of 30 cm. Various scenarios including water mist only, unsuppressed fires, and water-suppressed fires (methanol and n-heptane, both pool and cascading fires up to 400 kW) were investigated. O-2 concentrations were measured at a 2.5 Hz repetition rate with a resolution of 0.01 to 1 vol % O-2 depending on the transmission conditions. This demonstrated for the first time the capability for in situ oxygen measurements under fire-suppression conditions with large and rapid obscuration changes (transmission of as little as 0.8% of the emitted laser power). It also showed that the TDLAS results account for dilution of O-2 by water vapor without any interference of other species.},

	Abstract = {it is well established that the use of water mist can be an attractive alternative to gaseous suppression agents to extinguish fires for specific scenarios. The fundamental mechanisms involved-gas-phase cooling and dilution-are largely described in previous papers. But much attention must be paid to a less predictable effect such as radiant heat-transfer change, especially regarding the energy balance at the fuel surface and, therefore, the rate of generation of flammable vapors. The objective of this work is to analyze, on the one band, the perturbing influence of a mist addition as an opposed flow to a small-scale liquid (heptane) pool fire structure, especially at its base, the more interesting zone regarding the mechanisms of flame stabilization and extinction and, on the other hand, the effect on the surface radiant heat feedback. A mapping is presented of the two major parameters, temperature and extinction coefficient, that control the thermal radiation of the flame. A comparative analysis of the fields deduced from averaged values, without and with mist addition, evidences an overall cooling effect and a loss of the structure of the flame with a periodic short phase of disruptive expansion due to the rapid vaporization of water droplets. These fields also provide a database for use in subsequent radiation computation. The measurements result in a new and interesting information: during water mist addition the burning rate increases, signifying an increase in both convective and radiative heat flux to the surface. The droplets and the water vapor do not shield the pool surface from radiation. The evolution of flammable vapor being not reduced, it is argued that oxygen displacement plays the major role in the suppression effect.},

	Abstract = {The use of water mist to extinguish fires is a problem of particular interest since the banning of halogen-based agents for environmental reasons. This interest is reflected in the large number of studies performed on the main mechanisms of extinguishment: heat extraction, oxygen displacement and attenuation of radiant heat fluxes. In contrast, little is still known about the chemical and some other aspects of water vapor addition in hydrocarbon diffusion flames.
In this paper, a phenomenological study is conducted of the effect of water vapor addition, through the base of a small-scale heptane pool fire. Heptane, supported on a pool of liquid water, is burned as a pool flame while the water underneath is heated to boiling. This is a unique and original method in that boiling the water under the fuel is used for adding water vapor at the base of a diffusion flame where chemical reactions and air entrainment take place. This region is the most interesting regarding flame reactivity and soot formation and, in spite of the perturbing influence of the injected water vapor, the major characteristics of the flame are conserved.
The procedure permits measurements of exhaust gas composition by means of a flow through system. Measurements of temperature, CO and CO2 species concentrations, and monochromatic absorption coefficient which can be associated with soot concentration, are performed. It is seen that adding water vapor in such a way affects both physical phenomena and chemical reactions. That water vapor inhibits the soot formation and shifts CO to CO2 is further confirmed by injection of an inert gas instead of water vapor. However, the resulting heat release is not efficient enough to counteract the cooling effect of water vapor and the temperature is significantly decreased. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	Abstract = {A mapping is presented of the temperature and monochromatic extinction coefficient at the base region of a small-scale heptane pool fire before and during a water mist addition. A methodology, coupling extinction measurements at two wavelengths, permits to separate the respective contribution of soot particles and water droplets to these extinction measurements. The primary objective of this work is to provide new information about the flame structure at the base of the flame, region which has an essential role in anchoring the flame and in its stabilization and extinction. The results obtained could also be used, in further work, as a data base for the prediction of radiant heat flux to the fuel surface. The detailed measurements made show that the customarily described structure of the steady flame does not exist longer when mist is added. Due to the rapid evaporation of the droplets and the subsequent expansion effect, the flame is totally disrupted. With a more or less regular frequency, it seems "explode" with random lateral projection of reactive pockets. During this phase of lateral expansion, the flame appears to get wider in its central zone with clearances from part or the whole of the liquid surface. The flame looks like an annular flame anchored to the pan edge. Clearances are followed by re-ignition but sometimes a full clearance by extinction, depending on the characteristics of the mist application. It is especially seen that water mist has primarily for consequence to cool the flame and to push water vapor onto the fuel surface but also to increase significantly the level of temperature and its fluctuation in this zone. This suggests that extinction is rather obtained by a rapid and total clearance of the liquid, than from the reduction of the burning rate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Fire behavior is examined in typical building compartments. Only compartments having window vents and ceiling heights of typically 3 in are generally considered. Approximate mathematical formulations are used to describe the important physics related to developing and fully developed fires. A one-zone compartment gas-phase model, with some consideration to stratification effects, is used. Fuel properties are considered in the simplest, but most practical, terms. It is shown that the ratio of heat of combustion to heat of gasification is an important fuel variable. Both crib and pool-like fires are discussed. These represent the extremes of fuel burning rates affected by either internal or external combustion effects, respectively. Cribs tend to be controlled by their internal heat transfer and combustion rate. Pool fires are used in this context to represent fuels having a small radiation path length for their surface flames. Semenov diagrams are used to explain the characteristics of fires developing to flashover. It is shown that fuels with concurrent flame spread can lead to flashover at low compartment temperatures. Critical conditions exist in terms of fuel compartment properties. The effects of ventilation and thermal feedback are explained for fully developed fires. Fire plume temperature data suggest a maximum turbulent flame temperature in fully developed compartment fires of about 1500 degreesC for stoichiometric and adiabatic conditions. Experimental results for crib and pool fires are presented to support the trends indicated by the approximate analyses.},

	Abstract = {Engineering models have been developed to predict foam spread and extinguishment under fire conditions on liquid fuels in a research project called FOAMSPEX. A large number of experiments have been performed to generate input data and to generate data for verification of the theoretical models. The experiments include laboratory measurements of foam properties, foam spread tests in various geometries, field trials of foam monitors, and full scale validating fire tests. This paper gives a brief description of the model. Emphasis is put on the part of the project related to the foam spread experiments and the final application of the model to large-scale tank fires.
The main driving force of the foam spread is due to differences in the hydrostatic pressure within the foam while the dominating resisting force is due to viscous friction between the foam blanket and the fuel beneath for a pool fire. For foam spread in channels the friction between the foam and the sidewalls dominate. Account is taken to the influence of ordinary drainage, radiation-induced drainage, and evaporation.
The foam spread experiments were conducted both in a channel and a pool configuration. Some experiments were designated to determine friction coefficients between the fuel and foam and between foam and sidewalls. These coefficients have then been scaled and used for other fuels to calculate the foam spread in a number of different scenarios, both with and without fire.
Finally, the model has been used to indicate the foam spread in large-scale tank fire situations and the results have been compared with observations from some real scale tank fires. The results of the modelling support some of the existing recommendations according to NFPA 11 although it is clear that large diameter tanks will require higher application rates than presently stated. It is also found that the approximations introduced in the present models i.e. neglection of the consumption of foam due to the fire results in an underestimation of the time necessary to control the fire.},

The experiments were performed in a dedicated burning tray (2.0 m x 0 70 m working section), where wind velocity, fuel moisture content and slope were varied to study fire propagation in beds of Pinus pinaster needles.
All the runs were videotaped and, from the recordings, information on flame geometry (i.e. flame height, flame length and flame angle) and rate of spread was obtained. Temperature measurements were also carried out by a small tower of six thermocouples at different heights above the fuel bed.
Results show that headfire rate of spread increases steeply with wind speed for wind-driven fires but does not depend on wind speed for backing fire spread rates. Rate of spread increases slightly with slope for up-hill propagation, and is not slope dependent for down-hill cases. Rate of spread decreases when fuel moisture content increases. Flame angle and flame height are also dependent on wind velocity, slope, and fuel moisture content. The importance of temperature for fire propagation is discussed, emphasizing the role of radiation heat transfer in the process. Correlations between temperature and other indicators of fire behaviour (namely the rate of spread) are presented. Results are discussed and compared.
The results obtained provide a good database for the assessment of fire propagation models.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes experimental study of the interaction of fine water mists with solid pool fires. Fine water mist was generated by a single pressure nozzle and solid pool fires were produced from solid red pine or polymethyl methacrylate(PMMA). The LDV/APV system was employed to determine the water mist characteristics. The water mist droplet sizes and velocities from the nozzle were measured under varying conditions and at different locations. The effects of solid type, water flow rate, and nozzle distance from the sample surface on extinguishments time were examined. At a given water flow rate, the extinguishment time is much longer for PMMA fires than for solid pine fires. The extinguishment time was found to decrease with increasing water flow rate. At very low water flow, the extinguishment time decreases when the nozzle is positioned further from the sample surface. On the contrary, at high water flow, the extinguishment time appears to be independent of the distance between the nozzle and the sample surface. The experimental results show that flame extinguishments is due primarily to fuel surface cooling and wetting.},

The calorimeter inner surface temperature and the flame environment emissive power were measured at several locations as functions of time. An inverse heat conduction technique was used to estimate the net heat flux to the calorimeter Tall porous fences surrounded the test facility, to reduce the effect of wind on the fire. Outside the fences, 2.9 m/s winds blew across the calorimeter axis at the beginning of the test but decreased with time. The wind tilted and moved the fire so that the initial flame environment emissive power was substantially less on the windward side than the leeward side. The calorimeter became more uniformly engulfed as the winds decreased. The maximum heat flux to the calorimeter was 150 MW/m(2) on the leeward side at the beginning of the fire, and generally decreased with time. The local variations of calorimeter temperature and heat flux were closely related to the local flame environment emissive power.},

	Abstract = {Extinction in open space of flames from pool fires by downwardly directed water sprays has been investigated on two linear scales, one three times larger than the other. Circular pool fires were employed as fire sources, mostly in the form of gas discharge (methane) from a horizontal sand surface but also, to a limited extent, in the form of heptane pools. The results are presented in normalized plots based on scaling theory verified in a previous study. Extinction data from the methane fires are insensitive to the initial spray angle of the nozzle discharge. The data are consistent with an engineering relation showing extinction water flow rate approximately proportional to an effective nozzle diameter, and to the 0.4-power of both nozzle height and freeburn heat release rate. This result has been interpreted to indicate that spray-induced dilution of the flammable gas is a major factor in extinguishing fires from gaseous discharge. Extinction data of liquid pool fires from this study (n-heptane) and previous investigations (gasoline, JP-5) are consistent with the methane data, except for somewhat higher water rates at extinction.

Results are compared to the suppression effect of water vapor, gaseous thermal agents N-2 and CF4, and chemical agent CF3Br to determine if the theoretical thermal suppression effect expected for water mist can be experimentally achieved. These studies lay the groundwork (both experimental and modeling) for the effects of larger drops as well as for drops with solutes. Stoichiometric mixtures were stabilized at atmospheric pressure on one of two nozzle-type burners, producing cone-shaped flames. Burning velocities were determined using the total area method. An atomizer was used to produce water mist with a mean drop diameter of less than 1 mum, which was delivered as part of the reactant stream. Studies were carried out using both dry and humidified air. On a mass basis, the burning velocity of N-2- and CF4-inhibited flames exhibited similar characteristics. Water vapor was observed to be more effective than N-2 or CF4, but less effective than the same mass of water mist, consistent with thermodynamic analyses. Water mist inhibition results were well predicted by a recently developed multiphase flame model. Under these conditions, the burning velocity reduction effectiveness of water mist is approximately 3.5 times greater on a mass basis than for N-2 and CF4 and is comparable to modeled data for CF3Br-inhibited flames.},

	Abstract = {A new generation of models of a forest fire is currently being developed; they include more and more physical mechanisms. The main objective of the present study was to provide experimental measurements to test such models. An apparatus was designed to simulate and study in laboratory conditions the flame and the near-field plume stemming from the combustion of an isolated shrub. The burner was made of a cylindrical wire mesh basket filled with a forest fuel ignited at the lower circumference of the basket. Three diameters (20, 28, and 40 cm) for the basket and two kinds of fuel (Pinus pinaster needles and excelsior) were used. Temperatures were measured inside and above the burner using type K thermocouples of 50-mum diameter. Three pairs of these sensors were especially used to estimate the upward gas velocity, thanks to the expected cross-correlation of thermal fluctuations. We obtained varied and non-steady regimes of combustion as desired, in particular the maximum heat release rates ranged between 30 and 180 kW. The structure of the visible flame and its temperatures were analyzed for a fully developed flamed The height of a flame was found to scale with the heat release rate according to the usual two-fifths power law, which enables a normalized flame height to be defined. Vertical temperature profiles in the flame were found to scale with the normalized height and radial temperature profiles fitted Gaussian laws well. The determination of gas velocity was uncertain, but the usual scaling also applied to the measurements. Scaling rules, which apply well to either steady turbulent diffusion flames on a porous gas burner or pool fires, hold for the non-steady flame on our forest fuel burner, when observing a fully developed flame.

On a spectral basis, the radiative transfer equation (RTE) is obtained using the Mie absorption and scattering efficiencies, and the Henyey-Greenstein phase function is used to approximate the exact Mie phase function. RTE is solved using the finite-volume method. Results show the capability of the grey model to provide correct results for an optical thickness less than 2. For optically thicker media, an improved model is proposed. It consists in dividing the radiative intensity into three or more spectral bands and using individual mean Planck quantities for each band. Deviations from the reference spectral model results are estimated as well as the gain in computational time for a wide range of droplet sizes and concentrations.

The article extends the computations of Cai et al.

The two flame spread regimes are defined for both earth gravity and microgravity conditions. Pulsating flame spread behavior occurs if the initial liquid temperature and/or the oxygen mass fraction in the incoming airflow is sufficiently low. The roles of surface-tension-driven flow, gas buoyancy, liquid buoyancy, and hot gas expansion are analyzed. The effects of oxygen mass fraction, pool depth, and pool width are evaluated. For narrow pools (2 cm), the three-dimensional effects are focused near the poolside edges where the flame front wraps along the poolside edge but remains nearly two-dimensional over most of the pool. For a wider pool (8 cm), three-dimensional variations in flame shape occur over much of the pool. The behavior of the flame along the poolside edges differs significantly for earth gravity and microgravity conditions. The supply of oxygen due to buoyancy at the edges is an important factor. Contrary to previous speculation, the existence of a "valley'' in the surface temperature pro. le is not necessary to explain the behavior of pulsating spread.},

Before and after the application of water mist, some K-type thermocouples along the pool centerline and a digital camera were used to measure the flame temperature and visualize the process of the fire extinction.

A Particle Image Velocimetry and Sizing (PIVS) technique was developed to characterize the water mist. The experimental results show that both the flame of alcohol and kerosene cannot be extinguished in many cases when the pressure is lower than 0.4 MPa. In addition, the distance between the flame and the nozzle, and the application rate of water are two main factors which influence the effectiveness of the extinction of a pool fire when the working pressure is lower and the impulse injection of water mist can improve the effectiveness of fire extinction.

We present results that furnish a new insight into these questions, We have found that the flickering spectrum of the flame possesses some features that permit a flame to be distinguished from a potential source of false alarms. The new Waverex flame detector integrates these new results into the algorithms using a combination of wavelet and fuzzy techniques that has been developed in our laboratories.

Test results showed that the Halotron I and CF3I extinguishers performed better than the FE-36 and FM-200 extinguishers. The concentrations of the halocarbons and acid gas by-products in the operator breathing zone and surroundings were measured during the tests. Measurements showed that the agent concentrations were below the levels that would pose life or health risk to the operator. The concentrations of acid gas by-products generated during suppression, however, were at dangerous levels in the small enclosures (45 and 120 m(3)). Heat flux towards the operator was also measured, Heat exposure presented a severe hazard to the operator during the pool fire suppression. Test results indicate some potentially hazardous conditions to an unprotected operator.},

	Abstract = {The focus of this paper is on simulating water mist suppression of fires in large enclosures. A two-continuum formulation is used in which the gas phase and the water-mist are both described by equations of the Eulerian form. The water-mist model is coupled with previously developed codes based on the multi- block Chimera technique for simulating fires. Computations are performed to understand the various physical processes that occur during the interaction of water-mist and fires in large enclosures. Droplet sectional density contours and velocity vectors are used to track the movement of water-mist and to identify the regions of the fire compartment where the droplets evaporate and absorb energy. Parametric studies are performed to optimize various water-mist injection characteristics for maximum suppression, The effects of droplet diameter, mist injection velocity, injection density, nozzle locations and injection orientation on mist entrainment and flame suppression are quantified. Numerical results indicate that for similar injection parameters such as mist injection density, injection velocity and droplet diameter, the time for suppression was smallest for the top injection configuration. Water-mist injection through the side walls, the front and rear walls and through the floor were found to be less efficient than the top injection configuration. These results are compared with our earlier predictions on water-mist suppression of small scale methanol pool fires and other experimental studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The calculations were performed using the data of Rasbash et al. The emissive power of the disk flame assumed at the top plane of the vessel, which is determined from the heat balance in the combustion system, is approximately equal to the mean values of the radiative flux measured near the top plane of the vessel in the similar fuel type and pool size at the relatively small lip height. The calculated emissive power of the assumed disk flame decreases with time and approaches the asymptote, depending on the depth of the vapor zone. The heat of evaporation and the rate of increase of the sensible heat of the liquid increases and decreases, respectively, with time and approach asymptotes. The time evolution of the sum of them is similar to that of the emissive power of the disk flame derived from the heat balance in the combustion system. Even in relatively small lip heights and low emissive power flames, as in non-hot-zone-forming pool fires, the rates of heat transfer between the wall and the ambient fluids are large, and cannot be neglected in comparison to the heat input from above to the fuel surface.

The center, wall, and corner fire plumes for various sized Fires were studied experimentally in a rectangular pool fire using methanol as a fuel. The numerical results from a self-developed SMEP (Smoke Movement Estimating Program) field model were compared with experimental results obtained in this and from literature. Comparisons of SMEP and experimental results have shown reasonable agreement. As the fire strength became larger for the center fires, the air mass flow rate in the door, average hot layer temperature, flame angle and mean flame height were observed to increase but the doorway-neutral-planeheight and the steady-state time were observed to decrease. Also as the wall effect became larger in room fires, the hot layer temperature, mean flame height, doorway-neutral-planeheight and steady-state time were observed to increase. In the egress point of view considering the smoke filling time and the early spread of plume in the room space, the results of the center fire appeared to be more dangerous as compared with the wall and the corner fire. Thus it is necessary to consider the wall effect as an important factor in designing efficient fire protection systems.},

The magnitude of these values suggests that HBr, HCl, and HF can significantly impact calculations of radiative transfer inflames containing these species. Two sets of additional calculations were performed for CO to validate the methodology used for calculation of ap for HBr, HF, and HCl. In the first approach, which employed the narrow band model RADCAL, the calculation procedure was similar to that of the present calculations. The second approach utilized tabulated values of the integrated intensity for each CO band and an average value of the Planck Junction within each band.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were held constant at 0.04 kPa and the water vapor concentrations varied between 0.55-5.63 kPa based on temperature and relative humidity.

Opposed air flow to the flame spread due to forced and/or natural convection is considered. Unsteady computations are performed in order to study the ignition event and to describe both uniform and pulsating flame spread. Pools of finite width and length are studied in air channels of prescribed height and width, thereby requiring a three-dimensional space resolution in order to capture the effects at the edge of the pool and at the side walls of the air channel. The effects of variations in surface tension due to surface temperature variation and of buoyancy in both the liquid and gas phases are considered. One-step chemical kinetics, Fickian diffusion, Fourier heat conduction, and laminar flow with variable properties are considered. Boundary layers at the walls and at the liquid/gas interface are resolved. A moving mesh scheme is employed to follow the flame motion. Regions of pulsation are found at both 1 g and 0 g. Average flame speed and pulsation frequency increase with initial fuel temperature. Surface tension can have a major effect, e. g., cause a recirculation. Buoyancy can modify flame speed and flame shape. The flame extends over the edge of the pool producing some clearly three-dimensional effects, such as lateral air motion. The computations are intended to guide and to explain experiments that are being performed at NASA Glenn by H. Ross and F. Miller.},

It focuses on the use of the laminar flamelet approach and highlights the effect of microscopic radiation on the field predictions of temperature and species concentrations in compartment fires. The flamelet calculations with and without microscopic radiation are performed using RUN-1DL (Rogg. RUN-1DL Manual, 1099). Radiative properties in the flamelet are calculated by a modified exponential wide band model. Global radiation is coupled with the field calculation through the discrete transfer radiation method (Shah. Ph.D. thesis, Imperial College of Science and Technology: 1979) and Hubbard and Tien's (ASME J Heat Transfer. 1978;100:235-9) mean emission and absorption coefficient concept. The soot model of Leung et al. (Combust Flame 1991;87;289-305) is used for soot predictions. Improved agreement with experimental data on temperature distributions has been achieved by including the microscopic radiation in the flamelet calculation. Microscopic radiation is also found to have significant effect on the predictions of soot and OH radical but its effect on the predictions of CO2, CO and H2O are found to be marginal. The present study recommends that radiative heat exchange at microscopic level (within the laminar flamelet) should be included when using the laminar flamelet approach to compute turbulent reacting flows.

In this paper, the combustion process of water-in-oil emulsion layers floating on top of a water body, as in the case of in situ burning of oil spilled at sea that has turned into emulsion, is modeled by using comprehensive mathematical treatment, and the results are compared with data obtained in our lab. The burning process model is divided into three regimes, as follows:
1. The initial regime begins when the emulsion layer floating on the ocean surface receives heat flux from an external source, such as an igniter or a burning oil pool;
2. The intermediate regime begins from the instant of the first appearance of an oil layer on the top of the emulsion layer due to breaking of the emulsion and continues until the oil starts to evaporate;
3. The final regime begins with the combustion of oil vapor, and ends when the fire extinguishes.
The laboratory tests were conducted: 1) to establish a critical (i.e., minimum) external heat flux value to cause self-sustaining combustion of the emulsion layer for various emulsion compositions, and 2) to generate burn rate and other emulsion pool fire characteristics, such as time for emulsion separation, burn rate, burn time, and residue Volume left. Measurements were made for emulsions of commercial no. 2 diesel oil, having 20% to 80% water by volume. The model was solved numerically by using finite difference method.

The gas phase combustion model adopts the one developed by Chen and Weng (1990). For droplets, their motions are described by Newton's second law. The corresponding droplet heat and mass transfer are considered by using empirical correlations. The PSI-Cell model is used to manage the two-phase coupling. The evaporation of droplets through heat absorption from the flame can generate vapor in the flow field. The vapor dilutes both the oxidizer and fuel concentrations, and the heat absorption by phase change lowers the flame temperature, For 50 pm droplets, the envelope flame is extinguished from the forward stagnation area and becomes a wake flame as the mist flow rate increases to 7%. The wake flame no longer exists when the mist flow rate is greater than 15%. The critical values for transition of the envelope flame to a wake flame and complete flame extinction for 80 mum droplets were 4.5% and 10% separately. Under the same mist flow rate, the smaller the droplet sizes, the stronger the flame. The effect of droplet size is studied by changing the droplet size and the corresponding mist flows with the number flow rate constant. The critical sizes for transition of the envelope flame to a wake flame and for complete flame extinction were 55 pm and 75 mum respectively. Future work is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The behaviour of a turbulent diffusion flame subjected to cross wind conditions is studied numerically using a finite-volume procedure. A k - is an element of - gRNG turbulence model and a P-probability density function (pdf) are used for the description of the turbulent nonpremixed combustion process. The gas/soot radiation model used in the analysis is based on the P1-difterential approximation method and coupled with a two-equation submodel for soot formation. This model is applied to methane/air flames for cross wind velocity ranging from 0.5 mls to 2 m/s. For a moderate wind of 1 m/s, the transient behaviour of the flame associated with the development of buoyancy-driven large structures is examined. Under different windy conditions, numerical results show that the nature of instabilities which develop along the thermal plume, depends on the orientation of the density gradient with respect to the gravity. The wind effects upon the flame trajectories are analyzed from the angle of deflection between the hot gas stream and the wind direction. The numerical results are compared with an experimental correlation obtained for a pool fire. Temperature and soot concentration profiles are presented to illustrate how aerodynamic interactions may generate significant changes on received thermal fluxes, especially for leeward surfaces.},

Enhancement of the radiant heat transfer process ahead of the fire front under wind and slope conditions is provided in the current paper. Predictions are compared to data recorded during laboratory-scale experimental fires conducted across different pine needles bed under wind and slope conditions. Influence of these environmental factors on rate of spread, temperature-time profiles and fire front shapes is then presented. Predictions reveal that effects of flame radiation alone can account for observations up to limit value of slope angle and wind velocity for which convective mechanisms cannot be neglected. Below this limit observations are quantitatively well reproduced by the model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Extinction and scattering properties at wavelengths of 250-5200 nm were studied for soot emitted from buoyant turbulent diffusion flames in the long residence time regime where soot properties are independent of position in the overfire region and characteristic flame residence times. Flames burning in still air and fueled with gas (acetylene, ethylene, propane, and propylene) and liquid (benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, and n-heptane) hydrocarbon fuels were considered. Measured scattering patterns and ratios of total scattering/absorption cross sections were in good agreement with predictions based on the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (RDG) scattering approximation in the visible. Measured depolarization ratios were roughly correlated by primary particle size parameter, suggesting potential for completing RDC methodology needed to make soot scattering predictions as well as providing a nonintrusive way to measure primary soot particle diameters. Measurements of dimensionless extinction coefficients were in good agreement with earlier measurements for similar soot populations and were independent of fuel type and wavelength except for reduced values as the near ultraviolet was approached The ratios of the scattering/absorption refractive index functions were independent of fuel type within experimental uncertainties and were in good agreement with earlier measurements. The refractive index function for absorption was similarly independent of fuel type but was larger than earlier reflectometry measurements in the infrared Ratios of total scattering/absorption cross sections were relatively large in the visible and near infrared, with maximum values as large as 0.9 and with values as large as 0.2 at 2000 nm, suggesting greater potential for scattering from soot particles to affect flame radiation properties than previously thought.},

The effective heat of combustion, radiative heat loss fraction and smoke yield were calculated on the basis of the measured data. It was found that the heat release rate, mass loss rate, flame radiation and smoke yield were a function of the type of crude oil.

	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of chemical species can be a critical determinant of chemical reactor performance. The spatial variation of air-fuel ratio in a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine has significant influence on fuel efficiency and emissions. We report the development of a fiber-based near-Infrared absorption tomography system, to measure the distribution of hydrocarbons in cylinder. It has been successfully applied to transient gas injections. The technique exploits the specific (but weak) hydrocarbon absorption of 1.7 mum radiation, which wavelength has only recently become accessible by availability of solid-state alloptoelectronic components. A standard telecommunications laser was also deployed to measure reference information. The measurement space is sampled by 32 dual- wavelength fiber-coupled measurement paths. The logarithm of the ratio of the two measurements yields the path Integral of the hydrocarbon absorption, and hence, of concentration. The path integral is measured with typically 28 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Single-channel characterization shows that the technique is readily calibrated for temperature and pressure effects, over the region 70-150 degreesC and 1-10 bar. Tomographic reconstruction of different gaseous hydrocarbon flows has been achieved with spatial resolution of the order D/5, where D is the vessel diameter. Temporal resolution of about 1000 frames/s is demonstrated. (C) 2001 SPIE and IS\&T.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes an investigation into the behaviour of smoke plumes from pool fires, and the subsequent generation of empirical models to predict plume rise and dispersion from such a combustion source. Synchronous Video records of plumes were taken from a series of small-scale (0.06-0.25m(2)) outdoor methanol/toluene pool fire experiments, and used to produce sets of images from which plume dimensions could be derived. Three models were used as a basis for the multiple regression analysis of the data set, in order to produce new equations for improved prediction. Actual plume observations from a large (20.7m x 14.2m) aviation fuel pool fire were also used to test the predictions. The two theoretically based models were found to give a better representation of plume rise and dispersion than the empirical model based on measurements of small-scale fires. It is concluded that theoretical models tested on small-scale fires (heat output approximate to 70 kW) can be used to predict plume behaviour from much larger combustion sources (heat output approximate to 70 MW) under near neutral atmospheric conditions.

	Abstract = {The storage of large amounts of polymers and other bulk chemicals is a potential hazard in the case of fire. There is at present a lack of knowledge about the implications of such fires, In particular the role of the ventilation conditions on fire chemistry has warranted investigation. A set of indoor, large-scale combustion experiments, conducted on five different materials is described in this article. The main test series was conducted using the ISO 9705 room, where both well-ventilated and under-ventilated conditions were attained by restricting the opening of the room, The degree of ventilation was determined using a phi meter. Furthermore, in addition to measuring the traditional fire-related parameters, extensive chemical characterization of the combustion products was made.
Two additional series of experiments were also performed, In one series of tests the size of the enclosure was increased and the fuel was placed in a storage configuration to simulate a real storage situation. In the other test series, three of the materials were tested as large-scale open pool fires.
The results from the three configurations are compared regarding yields of combustion products as a function of the degree of ventilation. For a number of toxic combustion products a clear dependence of the production on the equivalence ratio was found. Further, placing the fuel in a storage configuration did not significantly change the outcome of the combustion. Thus, the ISO 9705 room is of a size and scale that can be taken as a model for representing real-scale fires, Additionally it has been demonstrated that an advantage of the ISO 9705 room is the ability to alter the ventilation conditions.

	Abstract = {This paper presents field predictions for two confined jet fires under ventilation-controlled conditions. Three different combustion models, namely the laminar flamelet model, the constrained equilibrium (CE) method and the eddy break-up (EBU) model, are used and compared. The laminar flamelet model and the CE method are coupled with Lindstedt's soot model, while the EDU model is coupled with the soot model of Magnussen. The global radiative heat exchange is considered by using the discrete transfer radiation method (DTRM) and the calculation of the microscopic radiative heat exchange within the flamelet is embeded in RUN-1DL. For both the flamelet and CE methods, the energy equation is solved so that the radiation calculation is coupled with the computation of the turbulent combustion processes. Comparisons are made between the experimental data and the predictions of different submodel combinations for two propane jet fires in enclosures of 135 and 415 m(3). It is found that all the sub-model combinations predict the correct trends of distributions for field variables such as velocity, temperature, soot, and CO. The predicted temperature distributions from the flamelet approach, which includes both the microscopic and global radiative heat losses, are found to be in close agreement with the experimental data. Modifications are made to the convective heat transfer coefficients between the wall and the gaseous products in the impinging region and this is found to have improved the predictions for the wall heat fluxes.

Experiments have been executed, which were aimed on the investigation of the behaviour of vessels with LPG (50 l), equipped with protective devices during total fire engulfment. It was found out that the safety valve prevented an explosion of the vessels without any other protective measures. The presence of the intumescent fire retardant coating caused a significant delay in operation of the safety valve. A rather good agreement between the theoretical and experimental data was obtained.

	Abstract = {A study was performed to elucidate the mechanisms of extinction and autoignition of n-heptane in strained laminar Rows under non-premixed conditions. A previously developed detailed mechanism made up of 2540 reversible elementary reactions among 556 species was the starting point for the study The detailed mechanism was previously used to calculate ignition delay times in homogeneous reactors, and concentration histories of a number of species in plug-flow and jet-stirred reactors. An intermediate mechanism made up of 1282 reversible elementary reactions among 282 species and a short mechanism made up of 770 reversible elementary reactions among 159 species were assembled from this detailed mechanism. Ignition delay times in an isochoric homogeneous reactor calculated using the intermediate and the short mechanism were found to agree well with those calculated using the detailed mechanism. The intermediate and the short mechanism were used to calculate extinction and autoignition of n-heptane in strained laminar flows. Steady laminar flow of two counterflowing streams toward a stagnation plane was considered. One stream, made up of prevaporized n-heptane and nitrogen, was injected from the fuel boundary, and the other stream, made up of air and nitrogen, was injected from the oxidizer boundary. Critical conditions of extinction and autoignition given by the strain rate, temperature, and concentrations of the reactants at the boundaries were calculated. The results were found to agree well with experiments. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the influence of various elementary reactions on autoignition. At all values of the strain rate investigated hare, high-temperature chemical processes were found to control autoignition. In general, the influence of low-temperature chemistry was found to increase with decreasing strain. A key finding of the present study is that strain has more influence on low-temperature chemistry than the temperature of the reactants.},

The experiments were conducted with 50cm diameter pan heptane and JP8 pool fires. Mist was injected into the fire from the base at 90 degrees and 45 degrees and from the top at 90 degrees. The results show that base injection of droplets enhanced their suppression effectiveness by as much as two times. Secondly, optimum suppression effectiveness is obtained with small droplets injected at the base of the fire. This is because the droplets evaporated quickly within the lower region of the fire where a greater effect of oxygen dilution and water vapor higher heat capacity is fully realized. Finally, a comparison of the results with the two fuels show that water mist is more effective in suppressing the JP8 fires than the heptane fires. It is concluded that the additional effects of direct surface cooling contributed significantly to the observed difference.},

The measurement allows the determination of the mass-generation rate of smoke and smoke yield during a fire test with little more time or labour than is required for performing heat-release-rate and mass-loss-rate measurements, The new smoke concentration meter was motivated by the finding from several studies of a nearly universal value of the specific extinction coefficient of post-flame smoke produced by over ventilated fires, Key design features include the use of a stabilized laser, purge flow to eliminate smoke deposition on the optics, U channel construction to minimize the effect of heating on the optical alignment and beam correction optics. The facility was fabricated almost entirely from commercially available components to allow this design to be easily reproduced by fire research and testing laboratories. The smoke concentration meter was able to measure a smoke yield as small as 0.005 for a propane fire to as large as 0.10 for a toluene pool fire. A detailed uncertainty assessment was made, The result for a 50 cm diameter heptane pool fire agrees well with previous smoke yield measurements made for the same fuel and pool diameter based on filter collection and weighing, Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Soot from flames fueled with gaseous (acetylene, ethylene, propylene, and butadiene) and liquid (benzene, cyclohexane, toluene, and n-heptane) hydrocarbon fuels were studied. Scattering and extinction measurements were interpreted to find soot optical properties using the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans/polydisperse-fractal-aggregate theory after establishing that this theory provided good predictions of scattering patterns over the present test range. Effects of fuel type on soot optical properties were comparable to experimental uncertainties. Dimensionless extinction coefficients were relatively independent of wavelength for wavelengths of 400-800 nm and yielded a mean value of 8.4 in good agreement with earlier measurements. Present measurements of the refractive index function for absorption, E(m), were in good agreement with earlier independent measurements of Dalzell and Sarofim and Stagg and Charalampopoulos present values of the refractive index function for scattering, F(m), however, only agreed with these earlier measurements for wavelengths of 400-500 nm but otherwise increased with increasing wavelength more rapidly than the rest. The comparison between present and earlier measurements of the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index was similar to E(m) and F(m).},

Measured data include external radiation, infrared image of the flame, flame temperature, gas concentration inside the flame, and other burning characteristics. The height of the strongest radiant emittance was H/D=0.1 to 0.2, where D=pan diameter and H=height from the initial fuel surface, and a kind of fireball appeared occasionally at the intermittent flame zone. Emitted smoke particles were sampled on the ground and observed with a scanning electron micrograph, and the distribution of the diameters of the primary smoke particles was examined. The average diameter of primary smoke particles is 53.0 (+/- 10.5) nm. The dependence of burning characteristics and flame structure on pan diameter is discussed. The flame height of the 20-m diameter pan fire is 1.9 (+/- 0.3) .D. The burning rate increases as the pan diameters increase, but the radiative fraction decreases as pan diameter increases.},

@article{Gulder2000,
	Abstract = {Small-scale laboratory pool flames of methanol were studied experimentally to determine the liquid fuel depletion rates and the water transport between the gas-phase and the liquid-phase. All experimental observations were made in the unsteady burning mode covering the period from ignition to complete burnout. The pool diameters were 46.5, 97 and 138.5 mm. Five flame conditions with different pool diameters and various pool depths were investigated. Experimental results showed that the amount of water in the liquid-phase increased significantly as the burning progressed. It was shown that this was due to the transport of water in the gas-phase to the relatively cooler liquid surface. The physical mechanism that would produce the observed results was argued to be the following: water vapor condenses at the gas-liquid interface and dissolves into the pool liquid. The condensation heat release increases the enthalpy of the liquid-phase and hence can augment pool liquid evaporation. However, as the water fraction in the liquid-phase increases, so does the equilibrium saturation temperature of the water-methanol mixture. This means that a portion of the enthalpy contributed by water vapor condensation in the liquid-phase is spent to compensate for the increased saturation temperature. The vapor-liquid equilibrium compositions of methanol-water mixtures exhibit a nonlinear behavior such that the water vapor mole fraction above the liquid surface is smaller than the water mole fraction in liquid-phase resulting in an accumulation of water in the pool as the burning progresses.

	Abstract = {Because of its many positive attributes, halon 1301, or trifluorobromomethane (CF3Br), has been used as a fire extinguishing agent in many applications, including aircraft, ships, and specialized structures. Due to its high ozone depletion potential, however, world-wide production was halted in 1994. In the search for a Long-range replacement, novel types of extinguishing agents and delivery mechanisms are under development. To gauge the suitability of a replacement agent, methods are needed to evaluate the materials suppression effectiveness under conditions that relate to field applications.
In this study, a laboratory-scale facility has been developed to screen the suppression effectiveness of agents that are delivered ill a transient fashion, such as solid propellant gas generators. The facility features a pool fire stabilized behind all obstruction, which is known to be a highly challenging suppression configuration. The character of the flame and the impact of the air flow, propane flow obstruction geometry, and rate of agent addition on the amount of material needed for suppression are examined for N-2 and CF3Br, The impact of the injection process on the flowfield and the transport of the agent downstream are examined. A simple mixing model is useful to explain the observed trend of decreasing suppressant mass fraction with increasing injection duration, even for agents as different as CF,Br and Nz. Direct numerical simulation of the suppression event is shown to successfully predict the quantity and rate of N2 required to extinguish die flame based upon a published global reaction rate for premixed propane/air flame propagation.},

Preliminary computations predicted a collapse of the thermal stratification during the 'sealed' stage, in contradiction with the observations.

The relative contribution of the various suppression mechanisms such as oxygen dilution, radiation and thermal cooling is investigated. Parametric studies are performed to determine the effect of mist density, injection velocity and droplet diameter on entrainment and suppression of pool fires, These results are reported in terms of reduction in peak temperature, effect on burning rate and changes in overall heat release rate. Numerical simulations indicate that small droplet diameters exhibit smaller characteristic time for decrease of relative velocity with respect to the gas phase, and therefore entrain more rapidly into the diffusion flame than larger droplet. Hence for the co-flow injection case, smaller diameter droplets produce maximum flame suppression for a fixed amount of water mist. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The set of coupled transport equations is solved numerically using a finite volume method, including a high order Ultra-Quick convective scheme to avoid numerical dissipation. The velocity-pressure coupling is treated with a projection technique. The numerical results obtained for pool fire regime show that the flow pattern is characterized by the development of large structures which appear during the expansion of the thermal plume above the flame.

To evaluate the technique, samples of two different types of furnace blacks, two types of graphite, a synthetic diamond and a C-70 fullerene also were analyzed. With proper experimental design, the C-70 produced a single peak of mass 840 Da. thereby showing the ability of LDMS to remove and singly ionize large intact molecular species from the sample for the purpose of chemical analysis. The LDMS soot analysis showed that each mature soot has a unique chemical fingerprint. A family of fuels (e.g., normal alkanes) produces soot that is similar in appearance when mature and that therefore might be expected to yield similar mass spectra, but it is found instead that each spectrum has unique features that are different for each parent fuel. These initially surprising results point to the need for further study of fuel pyrolysis in flames.},

	Abstract = {Effects of the Lewis number and radiative heat loss on flame bifurcations and extinction of CH4/O-2-N-2-He flames are investigated numerically with detailed chemistry. Attention is paid to the interaction between radiation heat loss and the Lewis number effect, The Planck mean absorption coefficients of CO, CO2, and H2O are calculated using the statistical narrow-band model and compared with the data given by Tien, The use of Tien's Planck mean absorption coefficients overpredicts radiative heat loss by nearly 30 % in a counterflow configuration. The new Planck mean absorption coefficients are then used to calculate the extinction limits of the planar propagating flame and the counterflow flame when the Lewis number changes from 0.967 to 1.8, The interaction between radiation heat loss and the Lewis number effect greatly enriches the phenomenon of flame bifurcation. The existence of multiple flames is shown to be a physically intrinsic phenomenon of radiating counterflow flames. Eight kinds of typical patterns of flame bifurcation are identified. The competition between radiation heat loss and the Lewis number effect results in two distinct phenomena, depending on if the Lewis number is greater or less than a critical value. Comparisons between the standard limits of the unstrained flames and the flammability limits of the counterflow flames indicate that the flammability limit of the counterflow flame is lower than the standard limit when the Lewis number is less than the critical value and is equal to the standard limit when the Lewis number is higher than this critical value. Finally, a G-shaped curve and a K-shaped curve which respectively represent the flammable regions of the multiple flames for Lewis numbers lower and higher than the critical value are obtained. The G- and K-shaped curves show a clear relationship between the stretched counterflow flame and the unstrained planar flame. The present results provide a good explanation of the physics revealed experimentally in microgravity.},

	Abstract = {The flicker of a flame is an important physical parameter associated with the characteristics of a combustion process. This paper presents a novel instrumentation system developed for on-line continuous flicker measurements of combustion flames. The system comprises a high-speed CCD camera, a frame grabber and associated image processing software. The flicker signal was obtained by processing the radiation intensity of individual pixels within the luminous region of a flame image. Power spectral density analysis was performed to obtain the frequency components of the flicker signal. The quantitative flicker of a flame is defined in terms of weighted spectral components in the frequency domain and this definition has been proven to be well suited to quantification of the flickering characteristics of a flame. A tungsten lamp driven by a frequency-varying power supply was employed to calibrate the measurement system. The calibration results show that the system is capable of measung the flicker of an unknown light source with a relative error no greater than 3%. The system developed has been utilized to investigate the relationship between the flicker of a diffusion flame and the burner diameter, and to study the effect of the equivalence ratio on the flicker of a premixed flame under a range of combustion conditions. The experimental results obtained by both motion image analysis and spectral analysis have demonstrated that the flicker of a diffusion flame depends predominantly on the burner diameter. It has also been found that the flicker of a premixed flame varies with the equivalence ratio and a peak flicker exists for a given air flow rate.},

	Abstract = {The burning rate of a slick of oil on a,vater bed is calculated by a simple expression derived from a one-dimensional heat conduction equation. Heat feedback from the dame to the surface is assumed to be a constant fraction of the total energy released by the combustion reaction, The constant fraction (chi) is named the burning efficiency and represents an important tool in assessing the potential of in situ burning as a counter-measure to an oil-spill. The total heat release, as a function of the pool diameter, is obtained from an existing correlation, It is assumed that radiative heat is absorbed close to the fuel surface, that conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer in the liquid phase and that the fuel boiling temperature remains constant. By matching the characteristic thermal penetration length scale for the fuel/water system and an equivalent single layer system, a combined thermal diffusivity can be calculated and used to obtain an analytical solution for the burning rate. Theoretical expressions were correlated with crude oil and heating oil, for a number of pool diameters and initial fuel layer thickness, Experiments were also conducted with emulsified and weathered crude oil. The simple analytical expression describes well the effects of pool diameter and initial fuel layer thickness permitting a better observation of the effects of weathering, emulsification and net heat feedback to the fuel surface. Experiments showed that only a small fraction of the heat released by the flame is retained by the fuel layer and water bed (of the order of 1%), The effect of weathering on the burning rate decreases with the weathering period and that emulsification results in a linear decrease of the burning rate with water content.

	Abstract = {With the recent developments in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers it is becoming more feasible to place these instruments in field environments. As a result, there has been enormous increase in the use of FTIR techniques for a variety of qualitative and quantitative chemical measurements. These methods offer the possibility of fully automated real-time quantitation of many analytes; therefore FTIR has great potential as an analytical tool. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA) has developed protocol methods for emissions monitoring using both extractive and open-path FTIR measurements. Depending upon the analyte, the experimental conditions and the analyte matrix, approximately 100 of the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the 1990 U.S.EPA Clean Air Act amendment (CAAA) can be measured. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a program to provide quality-assured infrared absorption coefficient data based on NIST prepared primary gas standards. Currently, absorption coefficient data has been acquired for approximately 20 of the HAPs. For each compound, the absorption coefficient spectrum was calculated using nine transmittance spectra at 0.12 cm(-1) resolution and the Beer's law relationship. The uncertainties in the absorption coefficient data were estimated from the linear regressions of the transmittance data and considerations of other error sources such as the nonlinear detector response. For absorption coefficient values greater than 1 x 10(-4) mu mol/mol)(-1) m(-1) the average relative expanded uncertainty is 2.2 %. This quantitative infrared database is currently an ongoing project at NIST. Additional spectra will be added;to the database as they are acquired. Our current plans include continued data acquisition of the compounds listed in the CAAA, as well as the compounds that contribute to global warming and ozone depletion.},

	Abstract = {The effects of cross wind on the behaviour of a turbulent diffusion flame have been studied numerically. The multicomponent turbulent reacting flow is approached using a two-equation (k - epsilon) statistical model constructed from the Favre averaging method. To improve the representation of turbulent fields in fully developed and weak turbulent regions, RNG (Renormalization Group) k - epsilon turbulence modelling is adopted. Infinitely fast reaction is assumed and the combustion rate is fully determined by the turbulent mixing rate of fuel and oxygen using the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC). Energy lost by radiation is taken into account and soot formation is computed for the evaluation of the absorption coefficient of the soot-gas mixture using the gray gas assumption. Calculations have been performed both with and without wind. The numerical results show that the flow is characterized by oscillations which affect significantly the flame behaviour. The development of shear buoyancy-driven instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz) results in the occurrence of large eddies in the thermal plume. As the cross wind velocity increases, a transition from buoyancy dominated flow to cross wind dominated flow can be noted along with a reduction in oscillation amplitudes. The influence of cross dow on soot formation and the impact of the fire upon leeward neighbouring surfaces are examinated over the 0. - 1.5 m/s cross flow velocity range.},

	Abstract = {An experimental simulation was conducted to investigate the mechanisms of boilover phenomena in liquid pool fires with water sublayers. Observations of fire behavior and instrumentation of the local temperature history in oil/water layers revealed that a typical boilover process can be divided into three phases, i.e. a quasi-steady period, premonitory period and boilover period. Our attention was mainly focused on the premonitory phenomena of boilover, which is generally considered as one of the most important factors leading to the occurrence of boilover. Experimental examinations demonstrated that boilover only happens after the fuel/water interfacial temperature e has reached the boiling point of water, and that it was the violent seething of water at the interface which brought about boilover. The emission of micro-explosion noise, one of the most prominent premonitory phenomena of boilover was examined in detail and found to be a result of the water boiling. The investigation on the premonitory micro-explosion noise of boilover illustrated that it is a possible means for early and remote detection of the occurrence of boilover in liquid pool fires. However, in a real fire situation, the micro-explosion is always contaminated by the environmental noise. Hence, pattern recognition techniques should be used to differentiate the micro-explosion noise from the unwanted background noise, and a predictive model should be used to evaluate the status of oil burning and predict the occurrence of boilover. A set of noise features and a practical model have been presented for these purposes. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These measurements provide the first in situ information on radiative properties, temperature, soot, and the associated time scales in large pool fires. Soot extinction coefficients on the order of 5 to 30 m(-1) were measured in the visible regime, indicating paths lengths for radiative transport in the infrared of approximately 0.1 to 0.3m. Temperature measurements follow an approximately normal distribution with a mean of 1400 K and a standard deviation of approximately 67 K. Integral length scales of approximately 0.25 m were deduced from the temperature data. This length scale corresponds to the size of the smaller combusting eddies visually observed in large fires. Soot concentration integral length scales of 1.4 m were determined from the absorption measurements. Soot volume fractions ranging from 0 to 6.0 ppm were measured. In comparison to laboratory-scale flames, excellent agreement was observed between the volume fractions determined by extinction and emission measurements, indicating a uniform temperature distribution (and hence uniform flame coverage) within the 2.0 cm long by 1.0 cm diameter cylindrical sampling volume. Soot volume fractions determined by emission show a strong peak in the PDF just above 1.0 ppm. The same peak is observed on the soot volume fraction determined by absorption, but an additional maxima in the PDF is observed near 3.0 ppm, indicating the occasional presence of thick, cold soot. The primary uncertainty in the results is due to uncertainty in the soot indices of refraction. Fortunately, the uniform flame volume observed in the results show that the environment is promising for the study of these refractive indices.},

	Abstract = {A phenomenological model of air entrainment into combusting regions of axisymmetric fire plumes is developed and compared with some existing experimental entrainment data. The model considers engulfment of ambient air into a fire plume due to the action of the toroidal vortices that are formed periodically close to the source of an axisymmetric fire. It is shown that the diffusive entrainment rates of air towards a wrinkled flame sheet representing the turbulent diffusion flame severely underpredicts the entrainment rates by at least two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the turbulent large-scale engulfment is the primary mechanism of entrainment. By describing the entrainment process as periodic engulfment of ambient air around the toroidal vortex rings and the frequency of formation and passage of these vortex rings in combusting regions of fire plumes, it is shown that the modeled entrainment process gives good agreement with the experimentally determined fire plume entrainment or plume mass fluxes. This model accounts for the physical processes of unsteady fire plume dynamics, including the effects of pulsations for the first time. The model predicts the plume mass flux to grow linearly with height above the fire source and to be independent of the fire heat release in the visible flame region. The predicted scaling with respect to the source diameter appears to be in the range suggested by the experimental data. Overall, this new model provides a better foundation for the scaling of entrainment rates in the near-field of fire plumes. The methodology can be extended to predict entrainment rates in other periodic unsteady vortex dominated flows, such as pulsating buoyant non-reacting plumes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The presence of labile pentacyclic rings in prominent compounds suggested that low temperature (400-500 degrees C) pyrolytic processes were operating in the butadiene flames. On the other hand, assemblages of ortho-peri condensed PAHs (mass 202-276; e.g., pyrene, benzopyrenes, perylene) with limited amounts of alkyl substitution indicated a higher temperature provenance (> 750 degrees C). Measurements indicated significant thermal gradients (430 degrees C to > 900 degrees C) in the vapor flames. The concentration of benzo(a)pyrene generated per gram butadiene burned in vapor fires was estimated between 20-58 mu g. Total concentration for all resolved compounds was c. 9000 mu g PAHs/g butadiene burned. The pool fire PAH yields were 50%-70% of those observed for the vapor fires but the measured flame temperatures were lower (350-500 degrees C). Nevertheless the PAH compound distributions were similar in many ways to those of the vapor fire, including the presence of the "high temperature" PAHs identified in the vapor fires. These and other compositional features of residues from both flames suggested that Diels-Alder reaction mechanisms were important and that relative flame temperatures did not fully account for observed PAH distributions.

	Abstract = {This paper examines the effects of pool size and fuel type on the characteristics of pool fires. The fuels studied include hydrocarbon solvents, alcohol and their blends. The large-scale experiments were conducted on 0.445 and 1 m diameter pools in two enclosures: 41 m long x 5.4 m wide x 2.4 m high and 25 m long x 2.7 m wide x 2.4 m high, under a ventilation rate of 1-1.2 m/s. In these tests, measurements of the fuel pyrolysis mass loss rate, heat release rate (from CO2 and CO concentrations as well as oxygen depletion), smoke extinction area (from laser attenuation), total heat flux emanating from the flame, and the yields of CO2 and CO were made. Bench-scale tests were conducted using the same fuels and fuel blends on 100 mm x 100 mm pool fires in a Cone Calorimeter-a well-known fire test method.
The hydrocarbon + alcohol fuel blends are used to create large pool fires for fire fighting training. The aim of this study was to: (1) Formulate a fuel blend which will produce a "hot" fire for realistic fire fighting training while generating a minimal quantity of smoke to comply with the pollution regulations. (2) Investigate the effect of fuel type and scale on the properties of the pool fires. (3) Make comprehensive measurements on pool fires in tunnels which can be used for validating mathematical fire models.
This study has resulted in the formulation of a fuel blend which satisfies the requirements of fire fighting training as well as Environment Protection Authority of New South Wales. The bench and the large-scale results correlate well showing good agreement between the heat of combustion, smoke extinction area (SEA) and the yields of CO2 and CO. The SEA increases with the CO and CO2 yields which in turn increase with the carbon fraction and the aromatic content of the fuel/fuel blend. The SEA correlates strongly with the CO and CO2 yields and in both the correlations, the entire data collapse on a single curve. These correlations indicate that the SEA and the CO2 and CO yields vary mainly with the fuel type, and not so much with the pool size. The flame heat flux increases with the carbon content in the fuel. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper is devoted to the effect of this type of flame on radiative heat transfer which can significantly increase the rate of fire propagation.
The proposed theoretical model associates the search for an efficient approach, the facility of use and an acceptable computational time. Its main characteristics are as follows:
two-dimensional formulation, the conservation equations being expressed in elliptic or parabolic form according to the local nature of the flow;
discretization by a finite-volume technique;
turbulence model k - epsilon;
conservative parameter combustion model;
soot formation model based upon a steady-state between formation and oxidation destruction velocity;
assumption of equivalent grey body behavior for calculation of radiative properties.
The model is validated using experimental data from two kinds of pool fires (small and moderate scales). The comparison of the predicted values with the fluxes measured in downwind or upwind positions shows that this approach is claimed to result in significant computational efficiency.},

Based on the review, a semi-empirical model was developed, in which the pool fire is assumed to radiate in two layers; a high emissive power, clean burning zone, at the base, with a smoky, obscured layer above. The choice and development of model correlations was made through comparison against a wide range of field-trial data, which was drawn together to form a validation database. The review also enabled a property database to be produced, containing burning rate and surface emissive power data for a broad range of liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

Further, it discusses the impact of model uncertainties in safety studies of industrial plants. The model evaluation group (MEG) is a European initiative on evaluation of technical models used within the major industrial hazard area and is supported by the EC DGXII, Directorate-General for Science, Research and Development. Closely related to MEG is REDIPHEM, which is the acronym of a research project supported by the EC Environment Research Programme focusing on assessment of the quality of experimental data and models for dense gas dispersion created within the EC funded research programmes. Technical models are used in a number of areas of industrial hazards assessment. It is becoming more and more apparent that most of these have never been through a procedure of evaluation, but nonetheless are used to assist in making decisions that may directly affect the safety of the public and the environment. As a major funder of European research on major industrial hazards, DGXII is conscious of the importance of ensuring that model development is of a standard that is commensurate with the importance of model use.
The aim of MEG is to improve the culture in which models are developed and used and so ensure that technical models used in all aspects of major hazard evaluation are up to date with technical developments and used by personnel well versed in their applicability and functioning.
In 1994, MEG finalized a generic protocol for model evaluation and guidelines for model developers. The two documents prepared by MEG have been through a preliminary review by 10-20 experts and will be further developed based on the experience obtained in the working groups. MEG has so far initiated three working groups on specific subject areas: dense gas dispersion, liquefied pool fires and vapour cloud explosions.
This paper describes the model evaluation protocol intended for users who wish to assess if a cel-tain model is appropriate for use in solving a given problem. Further, the findings from the REDIPHEM project related to dense gas dispersion will be highlighted. Finally, the paper will discuss the need for model quality assessment in safety studies.},

	Abstract = {A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study is combined with an experimental program to develop a model of burning rate and extinction in fires. The ultimate objective is to predict extinguishment by water droplets and thereby determine the water requirement for the extinction of actual fires.
The experimental program is conducted in a full-size are gallery with a commercial sprinkler system installed in the roof. Water droplet size distribution, velocities and mass flux from the sprinkler are measured as inputs for the computations.
Horizontal sheets of polymethylmethacrylate 1 metre square are uniformly ignited and burned in a draft of about 1 m/s. Burning rates are monitored by load cell and when the fire is well established, the sprinkler is actuated. A video record of the extinguishment together with thermocouple and heat flux measurements are used to time the event and to describe the process.
The primary extinguishment mechanism is considered to be due to the cooling of the burning PMMA surface below its vaporisation temperature. The effective heat transfer rate from water droplets to the hot surface is therefore important, and it is measured in a separate series of experiments on a heated steel plate. It is found that droplet dynamics on the limited size surface reduce the effective heat transfer by up to two-thirds of the maximum.
The CFD model, coupled to the solid surface, predicts the unsteady increase in burning rates and then the extinguishment of the surface. A lagrangian particle model and discrete transfer radiation model supplement the gas phase equations of motion, energy and species concentrations.
The predictions of burning rate are reasonably good and are sensitive to modelled radiative Feedback, a function of modelled soot concentrations. Extinguishment occurs regressively, but rapidly From the plate leading edge. The model is able to give a good representation of the extinction process and duration.},

	Abstract = {Visual observations, high speed movie sequences and image processing techniques have been used to examine unconfined vertical lifted turbulent diffusion flames issuing from precessing jet (PJ) nozzles. These techniques provide qualitative information about the dynamic motions in the flame and quantitative data on the size and number of flame structures, the celerity of those structures, flame dimensions, residence times and characteristic strain rates. The information is used to provide new insight into the flame stabilisation mechanism of, and combustion processes occurring in, a PJ flame and to enable a comparison with similar studies in free turbulent jet diffusion flames and pool fires. Large-scale structures are seen to form near to the base of the PJ flame and move downstream with a slow, nearly constant speed in a manner reminiscent of the puffing motions in a pool fire. The entrainment and mixing of these structures is such that the flame tip oscillates as the residual unburned mixture in each structure, becomes combustible and burns out rapidly as a single entity. It is proposed that the puffing motions in these unconfined flames are the result of a buoyant instability, which is analogous to that in a pool fire. However the buoyant puff structures are the result, nor the cause, of the stabilisation process. The high stability of the PJ flame, previously reported, is deduced to be related to the rapid decay in jet velocity and to the increase in entrainment which occurs in and upstream from the stabilisation region. The frequency of puffing is found to be uncorrelated with the frequency of precession. Global residence times and characteristic rates of shear are also measured and found to be reduced relative to those in a simple jet flame. The implications of the reduced shear on models of NOx generation in jet flames is discussed.},

	Abstract = {In pool fires of some liquid fuels, the isothermal layer, or ''hot zone,'' is formed below the burning surface, and increases in thickness with time. Mechanisms of heat transfer in such medium-scale hot-zone-forming poor fires were studied. The distributions of the tank wall temperature and the heat transfer tate between the tank wall and the surroundings (flame, gas above the fuel surface, fuel, and surrounding air or water) in 0.559-m-diameter fuel oil and gasoline pool fires such as reported by Burgoyne et al. were calculated using a finite difference program. The following conclusions were obtained from the calculated results: the heat input and loss of the fuel through the tank wall become sometimes dominantly large, and are never negligible compared with the direct heat input from the flame to the fuel surface; when the tank is cooled with water, the heat loss from the fuel through the wall is so large that the hot-zone thickness decreases gradually; the rate of increase of the hot-zone thickness increases with increasing thermal conductivity and thickness of the tank wall; in pool fires of lower hot-zone temperature, the convective heat transfer from the wall to the fuel is dominantly large at the upper layer of the hot zone; in pool fires of comparatively high hot-zone temperature and low thermal conductivity of the tank wall, the downward current of the fuel near the tank wall must be caused due to the heat loss from the fuel to the tank wall throughout the hot zone.

A downward-directed nozzle produces a fine water spray over a small-scale opposed pool fire. The fire extinction limit is obtained from minimum nozzle injection pressure measured when the fire extinguish takes place. The burning rare of the fuel is also measured using a verified technique. For the conditions tested, it is shown that there are two distinct regions in the relationship between the distance from the nozzle to the fuel pan and the injection pressure, i.e. a fire extinction region and a fire enhanced region. The effective water flux is shown to be a more useful parameter than the injection pressure for the fire extinction limit. It is also revealed that the larger the spray thrust the larger the burning rate is in the fire enhanced region. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Without drainage, using a rock type having a mass median diameter of 23 mm and with an initial oil level 51 mm above the MRSL, there was little change in heat release rate until the oil level regressed 25 mm below the MRSL; subsequently, the heat release rate fell sharply and continued at a low rate for >3 h, when the flames were extinguished manually. With drainage at regression rates of 16-26 mm/min, used in most of the experiments, there was no appreciable decrease in heat release rare until the oil regressed below the MRSL in this case, and the fires self-extinguished when the oil level dropped 23-29mm below the MRSL, depending on rock type (two types investigated). Heat release rates during active combustion (similar to 570 kW/m(2) convective) were little affected by oil drainage, the initial oil level, the preburn interval or the rock type in the ranges investigated.

Radiative coupling occurs when a comparatively cold object reduces the incident heat flux (by up to 65%) due to radiative cooling of nearby media. Convective coupling includes: (1) changes in the geometry of the flame zone, and (2) object-induced turbulence which alters and often enhances the flow, mixing, and, hence, combustion processes within the fire.

	Abstract = {Nitromethane (CH3NO2) Pool Fire Flames have been investigated analysing both, the radiation emitted from intermediate combustion radicals (diatomic molecules) in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) spectral range, and the near infrared spectra dominated by broad water bands. Comparing the UV/VIS spectra to calculated band provides, rotational and vibrational temperatures (T-rot T-vib) of OH, NH and CN have been determined. At local thermal equilibrium T-rot and T-vib must be equal. The determined temperatures show that the OH and NH emissions originate from pure thermal excitation (T-rot = T-vib = 2300 K-2380 K) but the CN emissions show additionally a chemical excitation indicated by different vibrational and rotational temperatures in the Boltzman factor (T-rot = 2100 K, T-vib = 4300 K). For a more detailed study of the flame, the emission of OH radicals has been investigated more extensively by monitoring a two-dimensional rotational temperature and emissivity profile. In cooler flame regions, the observed spectra are dominated by the near infrared radiation emitted from stable combustion products like water and carbon dioxide. Therefore, NIR spectra (1000 nm to 2500 nm) have been compared to broad band profiles calculated with a self-developed code basing on the data of the 'Handbook of Infrared Radiation of Combustion Gases'. The flame temperatures obtained by this method range from 1800 K to 1900 K. The results are correlated to flames of methane and nitrogen oxide which emit similar spectra indicating similar reaction mechanisms in the gaseous phase.},

The tests were conducted using nozzles installed at a 5 m height and 1.5 m spacing in a large test facility (2800 m(2) area and 18 m height). Two types of nozzles were tested: a low pressure nozzle operating between 1.2 and 1.5 MPa with flow per nozzle between 12.0 and 13.41/m and a multi-nozzle high-pressure prototype consisting of seven nozzles operating at 6.9 MPa flowing at 5.3 1/m per prototype. These nozzles were selected because they had been shown to extinguish IMO fire tests in enclosures with a protected area of 83 m(2) and a ceiling height of 4.5 m. The fire tests selected from the IMO procedure included 6 MW diesel spray fires on top of the IMO engine mock-up, a shielded 6 MW diesel spl ay fire adjacent to the mock-tip a 1 MW shielded diesel spray fire adjacent to the mock-up, and a wood crib within a 2 m(2) pan filled with heptane. In tests in which no additional enclosure surrounded the nozzles other than the test facility, fires were not significantly affected by the water mist using either nozzle. To further investigate mist-system capabilities, a ceiling was then placed directly over the nozzles at a 5 m height covering an area of 188 m(2). Using 90 high-pressure prototype nozzles, the test fires were not extinguished. A 940 m(3) enclosure was then formed by dropping tarpaulins to the floor from the ceiling. A 4 m(2) vent was placed in the wall. With the 90 high-pressure prototype nozzles, the 6 MW spray fire on top of the mock-up was extinguished. When the 6 MW fire was shielded beside the mock-up, the fire was not extinguished With the vent closed, the 6 MW shielded spray fire was extinguished. Under the same test conditions, a 1 MW shielded diesel spray fire and a 0.1 m(2) heptane pool fire were not extinguished. The fire test results indicated that protection of engine rooms with volumes of about 1000 m(3) is possible by optimizing current fine-spray technology while significantly larger volumes will require improved discharge characteristics.

	Abstract = {An experimental investigation of the turbulence structure of a medium-scale methanol pool fire has been undertaken to provide further insight into the complex physical phenomena which drive mixing and entrainment and thereby control development of the fire flow field. Laser Doppler anemometry was used to measure radial and axial components of velocity in the flaming zones of a 31-cm-diameter methanol pool fire. Temperature was measured simultaneously using fine wire thermocouples. Mean and rms values, correlation coefficients, turbulence scales, and autospectra of both components of velocity and compensated temperature are presented. Turbulent energy production, turbulent Reynolds and Prandtl numbers and other quantities of interest in the description of the nature of the turbulent fire flow field are given. Through the results, a consistent quantitative description of the fire flow field is developed, with much new information contained in the correlations and turbulence quantities. The temporal coupling between the formation and shedding of the characteristic large-scale structures in the fire, the air entrainment and the flapping flame fronts at the base of the fire is described through interpretation of the distributions of mean velocity, turbulence correlations and autospectra of velocity which are based on time averaged statistics. The flow is found to develop in a manner similar to a buoyant shear flow, but approaches classical shear flow behavior only in strongly entraining regions and in the thermal plume far above the fuel surface. High negative values of flux Richardson number suggest similarity to some aspects of large-scale environmental flows, while low values of turbulent Reynolds and Prandtl numbers are consistent with the notion of a rapidly developing, buoyancy-driven turbulent flow field. The results provide a comprehensive set of data useful in the assessment of the attributes and limitations of assumptions in existing flow models and in the validation of numerical predictions of the pool fire flow field.},

	Abstract = {Optical depths in the visible to infrared spectral region were obtained from solar extinction measurements with two sun photometers during the First ISCCP Regional Experiment Phase II Cirrus Intensive Field Observation in Kansas.
A method is described to correct sun photometry for gaseous absorption and is extended to estimate the water vapor amount. The approach uses a prior computation of gaseous absorption for the narrowband-pass sun photometry, parameterized with the slant-path absorber amount. These produce correction coefficients for gaseous absorption, as determined by LOWTRAN 7 models. Near-infrared channels were calibrated by modified Langley plots taking account of gaseous absorption.
After the correction and calibration, the aerosol optical depths at the wavelengths of 0.4-4 mu m were obtained for clear sky conditions. The aerosol optical depth at the wavelength lambda = 0.5 mu m was 0.1-0.2 during the campaign. The cloud optical depth at lambda = 0.5 mu m was obtained for cirrus events on 26 November and 5 December 1991 after correction of multiple scattering effects involved in sun photometry. The column amount of water vapor was estimated from the 0.94-mu m-channel measurement and compared with results from radiosonde measurements. The comparison has shown a good agreement within a 10% difference during the campaign when the equivalent water vapor amount ranges from 0.3 to 1.2 g cm(-2).},

Therefore, the behaviour of equipment engulfed in a fire, as well as its eventual influence on the fire, should be known. In this article, experimental data from pool fires of hexane (4 m(2)) and kerosene (12 m(2)) are discussed. The evolution of the fire up to its full engulfment is studied, as is the evolution of temperatures at different points of a tank engulfed in it. The heat release rates under the different operating conditions are studied. A method is developed to calculate the maximum combustion rate, both for the developing stage and for the fully developed fire. The hindering effect of the tank on the fire is discussed and quantified in terms of 'efficiency of hindered combustion'. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd},

The total angular emissivity of a rang of uncoated float glass samples was determined between 10 and 80 degrees C with an uncertainty of 0.5%. Both the normal and the hemispherical emissivity were nearly identical for all the samples investigated. No significant differences between the top and the bottom side were observed. Measurements sere also extended to borosilicate glass and glass-ceramic plates used for fire-resistant glazing, determining their thermal conductivity and angular emissivity behaviour. In order to obtain additional information, also the spectral reflectance curves at near normal incidence between 2000 and 200 cm(-1) were obtained using a spectroradiometer. The fact that almost identical curves were obtained for a wide range of float glasses (both sides) as well as for the fire-resistant materials confirms the correctness of the close emissivity values found. On the basis of the results obtained, a standard value of epsilon(n) = 0.900 and a epsilon(h)/epsilon(n), ratio = 0.936 is suggested for both float glass and for the two other materials.},

@article{Li1996,
	Abstract = {Length of jet diffusion flames is of direct importance in many industrial processes and is analyzed by applying scaling method directly to the governing partial differential equations. It is shown that for jet-momentum-dominated diffusion flames when the buoyancy effects are neglected, the flame length normalized by the burner exit diameter increases linearly with the Reynolds number at the burner exit in the laminar burning regime and decreases in inverse proportion to the Reynolds number in the transitional regime. For turbulent diffusion flames the normalized flame lengths are independent of the burner exit flow conditions. It is further found that for vertical upward flames, the buoyancy effect increases the flame length in the laminar and transitional regime and reduces the length in the turbulent regime; while for vertical downward flames, the buoyancy effect decreases the flame length in the laminar and transitional regime and increases the length in the turbulent regime, provided that jet momentum is dominated, and there is no flame spreading out and then burning upward like a downward-facing pool fire. Hence, for turbulent flames the flame lengths depend on the Froude number, Fr, and increase (or decrease) slightly as Fr increases for upward (or downward) flames. By comparison, it is found that the foregoing theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental observations reported in literature.},

@article{Kim1996,
	Abstract = {The present study investigates how water sprays affect fire intensity, the burning rate of fuel and the relationship between droplet size and degree of water penetration. Downward-directed sprays which interact with a small-scale opposed gasoline pool fire are experimentally investigated in an open environment. It is shown that the burning rate of fuel is always greater under this opposed spray-fire plume arrangement compared to the freely burning condition, i.e. without water sprays, when fire extinction does not arise. These results imply that water sprays are able to enhance an oil fire. Furthermore, very small droplets are shown to be ineffective for fire extinction by cooling because they do not reach the fuel surface through fire plumes. Therefore, within a small-scale gasoline pool fire in an open environment, the mechanism of the fire extinction by water sprays is concluded to act via the cooling of the fuel surface, which will lead to the suppression of fuel evaporation, rather than the cooling of the fire plume itself.

First, the combustion of a horizontal solid in a gaseous stream flowing parallel to its surface is presented. Then, a vertical burning wall is investigated. The structure of the reaction flows was studied in parallel, using simulation burners or water-cooled porous wall burners. The last part of the paper is related to the influence of gravity on wall and pool fires, and of cross-wind on the structure of the diffusion flames, and to phenomena involved in the generation and movement of smoke and in liquid pool fires producing boilover.

A component of the vorticity deduced from the velocity field shows a rapid increase near the maximum location of the visible flame interface. The results show that the mass of air set in motion by the fire is much larger than the mass that is entrained into the visible flame and the vorticity interfaces. The results highlight and need for use of a specific unambiguous definition of entrainment when comparing experimental data and correlations. The probability density functions (pdfs) of radial and axial velocities reveal both outward and inward instantaneous motion of air as well as recirculation. The outward motion is caused by expansion and the inward motion is caused by the vorticity generated by the density gradient. A net inward motion is caused leading to entrainment.

To model the response of the solid to the externally incident radiation, it is necessary to consider the spectral variation of radiative properties of the solid For highly absorbent solids, such as wood or particle board, almost all of the externally incident radiation is absorbed at or very near the surface. However, for highly semitransparent materials, such as a plastic material whose surface is not clean, the externally incident radiation is absorbed both at the surface and within the material. In this work, the objective is to study both theoretically and experimentally the importance of in-depth radiation. A transient, one-dimensional model is formulated and solved numerically. The spectral radiative properties employed in the radiation model have been obtained from separate experiments on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), a clear plastic. The model demonstrates the importance of in-depth absorption. Model results exhibit the same trend as those revealed in experiments for the rise in surface temperature of the sample.},

	Abstract = {An experimental study of boilover phenomena in oil-tank fires supported on water has been performed. It is found that a typical process of liquid fuel burning on water consists of three basic stages: a quasi-steady period, a boilover premonitory period and a boilover period. Basic characteristics during the boilover process such as the flame structure, the fuel burning aspects, and the thermal structure of the oil-water layer at each stage have been examined. In particular, phenomena such as water seething at the oil-water interface and combustion micro-explosion noise emission, which appear only in the boilover premonitory period, have been examined and analysed in detail. By correlative analysis of these sub-processes, it can be concluded that boilover premonitory noise is certainly emitted before the occurrence of boilover and is quite closely connected with the temperature distribution of the oil-water layer before boilover occurs. This conclusion is helpful in understanding the mechanisms of boilover phenomena and offers a practical means to predict the occurrence of boilover.},

To obtain further information on such entrainment rates, 20 full-scale, near-field experiments were conducted. Near-field entrainment occurs when hot layer interface heights are beneath the burner mean flame height so that cold layer entrainment occurs only near the burner surface. A durable compartment, similar to the standard fire test compartment, was designed and used in conjunction with a 0.61 m x 1.22 m porous surface propane burner to produce compartment fires with heat release rates from 330 to 980 kW. Entrainment rates of 0.74-0.98 kg/s were calculated from temperature measurements made within the compartment and in the doorway. The entrainment rates determined here were correlated with values from the literature. This correlation led to two curve fits which modify Zukoski's far-field offset model and can be used to estimate near-field entrainment rates.

	Abstract = {Twenty full-scale compartment fire experiments suitable for model comparison were conducted. Ceiling jet temperatures, surface heat fluxes and heat transfer coefficients which have not been previously reported are discussed. The ceiling jet temperatures 0.10 m below the ceiling show the effects of compartment ventilation, near-field entrainment conditions and burner location on the ceiling jet. Net and radiant incident heat fluxes to the upper and lower-walls and the floor are estimated. Combined (radiation and convection) interior heat transfer coefficients for the three surfaces are reported. As compartment fire models such as CFAST and FIRST continue to develop in sophistication, it is important that they be compared to experimental data. Data at three heat release rates: 330, 630 and 980 kW, are used to evaluate these comprehensive compartment fire models and two simpler models for the upper-layer gas temperature. CFAST predicts upper layer gas temperatures 150-260 degrees C hotter than the measured bulk outflow gas temperatures. The increased temperatures appear to be due to insufficient heat transfer through the compartment surfaces. FIRST predicts upper-layer gas temperatures that are slightly cooler (on average, 20 degrees C) than the measured bulk outflow gas temperatures. The two simpler models are within 40 degrees C, on average, of the measured upper-layer gas temperatures. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

By using a novel technique, characteristic length scales are extracted from the flame images. With this information and the use of empirical correlations, the mean centreline temperature distribution is obtained. The range of validity of this technique is determined by conducting experiments with a gas burner (250mm x 400mm). The heat release rate and Froude number are set so that the flames are characteristic of fire scenarios. Thermocouple measurements, along the flame centreline, are compared with the temperature distributions obtained from the video images. It was found that the video technique gives an accurate estimate of the mean centreline temperatures for different levels of confinement and heat release rates. There is no apparent colour or intensity limitation since good results were obtained for flames with dramatically different characteristics. Finally, the results obtained from the video recordings are also compared with previously reported experimental data and correlations with very good agreement, thus, confirming the possibilities of this technique in determining the characteristics of flames typical of building scale fires.},

	Abstract = {A computational model of flame spread over a thermally thick solid fuel in an opposing-flow environment is presented. Unlike thermally thin fuels, for which the effect of fuel surface radiation is negligiible for high levels of opposing flow, fuel surface radiation is important for thermally thick fuels for all flow levels. This result is shown to derive from the fact that the ratio of the rate of heat transfer by re-radiation from the surface to that by conduction from the gas to the solid is proportional to the length over which heat can be conducted forward of the flame to sustain spreading. For thin fuels, this length decreases with increasing flow velocity such that while radiation is important at low flow velocities it is not at the higher velocities. For thick fuels at low flow velocities, the conduction length is determined by gas-phase processes and decreases with increasing flow velocity. But at higher flow velocities, the conduction length is determined by solid-phase processes and is rather independent of the gas-phase flow. The result is that over a wide range of flow velocities, the conduction length of importance does not change substantially as it switches from one phase to another so that the ratio of radiation to conduction is of unit order throughout that wide range of flow.},

The longitudinal temperature distribution of the vessel wall and the liquid burning rate at the fixed liquid depth with vessels of various materials and wall thickness were measured, and also calculated by the finite difference program under some assumptions. It was confirmed that the heat that is transferred from the flame to the top of the vessel and conducted through the wall and then transferred convectively to the liquid fuel is dominant compared with the direct conductive and radiative heats from the flame to the liquid. The measured vessel wall temperature distribution and steady burning rate agreed well at relatively shallow liquid depth with the calculated results. In the case of vessels of very poor thermal conductivity and thinner vessels of good thermal conductivity, the agreement is good. However, in the case of thicker vessels of good thermal conductivity the calculated burning rate tends to become comparatively larger than the measured one, perhaps due to the heat loss through the base of the vessel. It is considered to be due to the deviation of the temperature contour at the base of the flame from the assumed one that the calculated burning rate deviates from the measured one increasingly with the liquid depth.},

Measurements included scattering, absorption, and extinction cross sections at 514.5 nm and extinction cross sections at 632.8 and 1152 nm for flames fueled with acetylene, propylene, ethylene, and propane. The measurements were used to evaluate scattering predictions based on the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (RDG) approximation for randomly oriented polydisperse fractal aggregates of spherical primary soot particles having constant diameters. The present soot aggregates exhibited significant departures from Rayleigh-scattering behavior at 514.5 nm, with forward scattering roughly 100 times larger than wide-angle scattering and ratios of scattering to absorption cross sections in the range 0.22-0.41, increasing with increasing propensity of the fuel to soot. The approximate RDG theory generally provided an acceptable basis to treat the optical properties of the present overfire soot aggregates, although additional measurements in the Guinier (small angle) regime are needed for a definitive evaluation of model performance.},

The theoretical results agree well with the experimental data. The luminosity of methanol/additive mixtures is found to be a function of the mixture's carbon/hydrogen (C/H) ratio. Flame luminosity increases with increasing mixture C/H ratio to a maximum (occurring around C/H = 0.35), and then decreases slightly beyond that point.

While the fractal dimension and primary particle diameter are narrowly defined, the refractive index, to which the results are highly sensitive, are disputed. Specific extinction was measured at lambda = 450, 630 and 1000 nm in a smoke-filled chamber with an optical path length of 1.0 m that was equipped to continuously monitor both particle mass and number concentration as the smoke aged during a 90-120 min interval. The smoke was generated by the burning of crude oil in a pool fire. Specific extinction at all three values of lambda was found to be constant even though the aggregate number concentration decreases by a factor of 24 owing to cluster-cluster aggregation. The refractive indices at several wavelengths that are required to give agreement with the measured specific extinction are compared with literature values.

Several theories have been put forward to explain this very energetic event but none have been proven. This paper describes a series of tests that have recently been conducted to study this phenomenon.
The study involved ASME code automotive propane tanks with nominal capacities of 400 litres. The tanks were exposed to a combination of pool and/or torch fires. These fire conditions led to thermal ruptures, and in some cases these ruptures resulted in BLEVEs. The variables in the tests were the pressure-relief valve setting, the tank wall thickness, and the fire condition.
In total, 30 tests have been conducted, of which 22 resulted in thermal ruptures. Of those tanks that ruptured, 11 resulted in what we call BLEVEs. In this paper, we have defined a BLEVE as the explosive release of expanding vapour and boiling liquid following a catastrophic tank failure. Non-BLEVEs involved tanks that ruptured but which only resulted in a prolonged jet release.
The objective of this study was to investigate why certain tank ruptures lead to a BLEVE rather than a more benign jet-type release. Data are presented to show how wall temperature, wall thickness, liquid temperature and fill level contribute to the BLEVE process.},

Transient temperature variation (eg. as found in turbulent combustion or turbulent convective heat transfer situations) is the most common mechanism driving index of refraction changes in systems probed with LDV. The physical phenomena inducing this bias, referred to here as flame-induced velocity bias (FIVB), are outlined. Combustion system velocity Rms biases of 10% are possible. The literature currently lacks a model to predict, and a list of criteria to minimize, FIVB. To fill this need a model is developed to predict the magnitude Of FIVB. Predictions are compared to experimental measurements Of FIVB in a pool fire to confirm the validity of the model. Specific criteria identified for minimizing the FIVB include maximizing the beam crossing angle magnitude; using a Bragg cell frequency shift to reduce sampling times to less than 1 mus; using the longest laser wavelength available; orienting beams parallel to index of refraction gradients to minimize the beam incidence angles; and when measuring velocities perpendicular to the main flow direction, orienting the beams such that the main flow is along the bisector of the beam crossing angle.

To avoid regimes in which the fire becomes too violent, the applied fluxes are intentionally moderate. Detailed measurements of the most important basic physicochemical properties that determine the characteristics of the flame are reported and used in the verification of the modeling of the process. This modeling is a coupled zone and field method, well suited to the present configuration. Exchanges are formulated associating geometric aspects (relation configuration of zones) and radiative aspects (emissitivity and absorptivity distribution along the different paths between zones). The measurements, being not instantaneous, provide averaged values where the measured properties are influenced by the fluctuating character of the flame. On the other hand, actual values are not. Therefore, it appears that the inclusion of a probability density function is convenient to predict accurately the radiative fluxes both to the liquid and adjacent surfaces. The results show that the resulting surface fluxes are practically additive (approximately the flux due to the flame itself plus the imposed flux). Thus, it appears that this small-scale pool fire operates this side of the nonlinear region of blockage effect.},

	Abstract = {The application of an electric field to a combustion system can produce large and potentially useful effects, such as reducing carbon formation, affecting flame velocity, extending flammability limits, increasing flame luminosity, and stabilizing and extinguishing flame. The present study is concerned primarily with the corona discharge interaction with pool fires. The fuel surface served as the blunt electrode and several specially designed sharp probes have been examined as the high-voltage electrode. The most effective sharp electrode appeared to be a simple thin wire parallel to the liquid surface situated above it at a distance of several millimeters. The flame was repelled from the probe, thus creating a possible pool flame extinction device. Similar results were achieved with a mechanical blower that reproduced the velocity profile of the electric wind. The gas composition in different locations was examined for both the corona and blower cases. No significant difference was found, and it was concluded that ion pumping has no influence on the extinction performance. It is suggested that extinction by corona discharge is caused solely by the aerodynamic action of the electric wind with its remarkably flat, sharp velocity profile. Fire extinctions under hot and aggressive environments are possible applications of the present device.},

	Abstract = {Computer-based simulation models are of increasing importance for technical risk assessment and consequence evaluation. Thus empirical and fundamental fire and consequence models are discussed that are qualified for fire hazard calculations. The empirical relations include open pool fires, enclosed pool fires, compartment fires, jet fires, diffusive flare fires, fires at sea and fireballs. A set of models rated to be reliable and of predictive power are integrated in the computer program FIREX, which is briefly described.
The three-dimensional field model KOBRA-3D is presented as an example of combined empirical and fundamental fire modelling. This model describes the buyoant convective flow in a forced or natural ventilated compartment, caused by a fire or heat source. The heat release can either be specified as external input data or can be calculated using an empirical relation for the dynamical burning rate of hydrocarbon pool fires. The efficiency of this complex simulation model, designed for personal computer applications, is demonstrated by comparing the numerical results with empirical data derived from fire experiments performed at the SINTEF Norwegian Fire Research Laboratory in Trondheim.},

	Abstract = {Several di-isocyanates have become commercially important materials, used as intermediates in the manufacture of a wide variety of polyurethane products, yet little is recorded on their behaviour if involved in fire. This paper describes a series of programmes carried out under the auspices of the International Isocyanate Institute Inc. First, a small scale laboratory investigation of the ignition, heat release, smoke and toxic gas production characteristics of di-isocyanates was carried out. Second, their behaviour in drumstock and pool fires, respectively, was examined, using full-sized samples and selected real-fire scenarios. Part 1 records the results for toluene di- isocyanate (TDI) showing the need for a modest energy input to ignite it from a pilot flame. It then bums in a steady rather than vigorous manner, leaving no residues. Toxic gases evolved are mainly carbon monoxide, while free isocyanate is likely in the early stages of the fire, and hydrogen cyanide may be important in well-developed fires. Drumstock material behaviour in a fire is dictated mainly by the rupture characteristics of the containers, which can be violent. A series of simple guidelines is suggested, which includes the need for firefighters to wear full protective clothing and fresh-air breathing equipment. It is also recommended that drumstock TDI should be stored away from easily ignitable materials.},

	Abstract = {Approximate methods for estimating the optical properties of flame-generated soot aggregates were evaluated using existing computer simulations and measurements in the visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum. The following approximate methods were evaluated for both individual aggregates and polydisperse aggregate populations: the Rayleigh scattering approximation, Mie scattering for an equivalent sphere, and Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (R-D-G) scattering for both given and fractal aggregates. Results of computer simulations involved both prescribed aggregate geometry and numerically generated aggregates by cluster-cluster aggregation; multiple scattering was considered exactly, considered using the mean-field approximation, and ignored using the R-D-G approximation. Measurements involved the angular scattering properties of soot in the postflame regions of both premixed and nonpremixed flames. The results show that available computer simulations and measurements of soot aggregate optical properties are not adequate to provide a definitive evaluation of the approximate prediction methods. The simulations involve either exact solutions for small aggregates where effects of multiple scattering are small, or approximate solutions of uncertain accuracy for the large aggregates of interest for practical flames. The measurements are limited to conditions where soot aggregate structure is not known, and for relatively large scattering angles where the various approximations yield similar results. Within these limitations (for aggregates larger than the Rayleigh scattering regime) the approximate theories performed as follows: Rayleigh scattering generally understimated scattering, Mie scattering for an equivalent sphere yielded unreliable results, while basic and fractal aggregate R-D-G scattering yielded best results for given and fractal aggregates, respectively. However, existing simulations suggest significant effects of multiple scattering for soot aggregates (except near soot inception conditions) that are not included in R-D-G scattering so that improved approximate optical theories for soot aggregates should be sought.},

A new correlation is derived and compared with experiments for flame heights in turbulent diffusion jet flames ranging from buoyancy-to momentum-dominated cases. The same methodology is used for correlating entrainment rates in turbulent diffusion flames, buoyancy or momentum dominated. The present results have been used to delineate various regimes characteristic of jet diffusion flames such as laminar, turbulent, buoyancy-dominated, momentum-dominated, and lift-off (turbulent jet) flames. Differences and similarities between the present approach and published results are also discussed.

This methodology consists of three steps: (1) select laboratory test methods to perform flammability measurements; (2) based on these measurements. obtain key flammability material properties which are precisely defined in this work; and (3) use these properties in a mathematical model of fire spread and growth to predict fire hazards. The complementary test methods we have selected and used are: (a) a general flammability test apparatus (such as NIST or FMRC) [1,2] modified to also provide pyrolysis measurements in an inert N2 atmosphere; (b) the Limited Oxygen Index (LOI) apparatus, which is used here as a tool for obtaining properties needed for creeping flame spread and extinction, including vitiated environments; and (c) a solid material smoke-point height apparatus [8], which is used to characterize the smokiness of the burning material needed to determine the radiation and smoke yield for arbitrary fire situations (wall fires, pool fires or ceiling fires) [8]. The use and proper interpretation of the Limited Oxygen Index apparatus can replace the LIFT [10] apparatus for determining in a more accurate and direct way the material properties required for creeping (vertical downward, lateral, horizontal) flame spread. The present methodology has been compared well with experiments in this work and elsewhere [9], and it has been used to predict critical conditions for fire spread [11], not empirically as it is usually done, but based on first principles of fire spread, fire growth and burning, together with material flammability properties systematically deduced from small-scale test measurements.},

	Abstract = {An experimental study of buoyant propane diffusion flames was undertaken to identify the mechanism responsible for the periodic oscillations near the source of these flames. This phenomenon, often referred to as ''puffing'' in the literature, exhibits itself as quasi-periodic oscillations of the diffusion flame front near the axisymmetric source of a fire with formation of large scale flaming vortical structures. Experimental diagnostics primarily involved flow visualization, velocity, and pressure measurements under a variety of experimental conditions. First, the behavior of buoyant, noncombusting plumes originating from 0.10- and 0.30-m-diameter sources was investigated with either isothermal helium or high temperature combustion products as the buoyant fluid. It was found that the helium plumes exhibited puffing at both scales with puffing frequencies similar to the flames scaling with D-1/2. The plumes of hot combustion products on the 0.30-m-diameter burner were highly turbulent and puffing was very weak compared with the flames that were generated upon ignition of the latter hot gas plume of vitiated combustion products. Second, effects of heat release were studied by dilution of fuel with a noncombustible gas. It was found that puffing persisted as long as a diffusion flame was sustained by the fuel stream, although its intensity diminished with increasing dilution. Third, effects of disturbances both internal and external to the flame were studied. These experiments strongly suggest that there exists a coupling of the flame front motion near the burner surface with the downstream development of large-scale flaming structures. Based on the reported experiments, a puffing mechanism is suggested. The puffing mechanism involves (1) acceleration of buoyant plume gas in stagnant surroundings resulting in formation of a toroidal vortical structure within one burner diameter above its surface, (2) the decaying influence of the toroidal vortex on the flame surface near the burner lip as it convects upward, and (3) the accumulation of buoyant gas inside the flame envelope and its buoyant acceleration to form the next vortical structure. The scaling of puffing frequency with the burner diameter is connected to the convection speed of toroidal vortices within one diameter height above the burner surface as it was shown with the use of a simple kinematic model.},

Correlation of the data allows one to predict chi(R), in terms of the: (1) fuel smoke-point laminar flame height, l(s), (or corresponding heat release rate Q(sp)), (2) adiabatic stoichiometric flame temperature, T(ad), of the supplied reactants, and (3) stoichiometric oxidant to fuel mixture mass ratio S. The existence of such a general correlation for S greater-than-or-equal-to 12 suggests that the buoyant flame radiation is effectively controlled by only these three reactant properties. The present correlation does not apply for S < 12 because of the increased importance of gaseous radiation for reduced S. The above correlation of turbulent flame chi(R) with the laminar-flame smoke point is achieved by consistently referring both (turbulent and laminar) flame systems to "Standard Conditions" (S = 15 and T(ad) = 2200 K).

Understanding the mechanism of WSB is important to predict the so-called "boilover phenomenon," which is associated with an intense spattering of water and fuel droplets. The in-depth physical structure and temperature profiles were obtained using a holographic interferometer for n-decane supported on water in rectangular Pyrex containers with large aspect ratios to provide two-dimensional conditions. The experiments demonstrated that: maximum temperature was achieved 0.1-0.15 cm below the fuel surface due to the combined effect of evaporation heat lass at the fuel surface and in-depth radiation absorption. As a result, Rayleigh convection was generated in the fuel near the fuel surface, and the total heat transfer rate to the fuel-water interface increased by approximately 30 percent. Hence, the water at the fuel-water interface was superheated, so that sporadic spattering of water and fuel droplets (boilover) resulted. To check the applicability of those results to a larger pool fire system and to different fuels, a rectangular container (10 cm long x 5 cm wide x 9 cm high) was designed and eight different liquid hydrocarbon fuels were tested, for all fuels the occurrence of Rayleigh convection was confirmed using fine thermocouples and a streak shadowgraph technique.},

Previously we designed a small-scale pool-fire apparatus and tested seventeen different (single and multicomponent) liquid fuels on water. Based on this established data, in this paper we describe a one-dimensional model to predict the time required for the water sublayer to start to boil (TWSB). The model includes the unsteady term in the thermal energy equation, along with conduction and in-depth absorption of radiation terms. To fully implement the model, radiation absorption was measured for toluene and Alberta Sweet crude oil as a function of fuel-layer thickness. The model calculation predicts the formation of inverse temperature profiles in the liquid due to the effect of in-depth absorption. Occurrence of the predicted Rayleigh convection in the fuel layer is confirmed using holographic interferometry, and its effect on TWSB is estimated by comparing the model calculations with the experimental results. It is found that a significant amount of heat is transferred from the upper fuel surface to the fuel-water interface by Rayleigh convection, while the heat loss to the walls is found to be moderate.},

	Abstract = {The work reported here simplifies computing the local Planck-mean absorption coefficient in nonluminous flames as a function of the mixture fraction and fuel composition.  Equilibrium is assumed for fuel/air mixtures up to the point where carbon is predicted to condense, beyond which the gaseous products are assumed to be frozen and to be diluted with cold fuel.  The resulting algebraic expressions are suitable for inclusion in any turbulent or laminar diffusion flame model predicated on single-step chemistry.  The method accounts for the nongray nature of the gaseous combustion products and their variation in concentration and temperature with mixture fraction, at a computational penalty little more than that for estimating variable fluid properties.  Nonluminous flames (in air) of H-2, CO, CH3OH, CH4 and lean regions of fuels with the general form CxHyOz can be modeled satisfactorily.  The effects of pressure-pathlength and heat loss on the absorption coefficient are addressed.},

The results show that the burning rate increases with the external radiation, but as the radiant flux increases its influence is reduced.  This seems to be due primarily to the related increase in the flame volume and opacity that attenuate the radiation that actually reaches the liquid surface.  Detailed measurements of the temperature, CO2, CO, and O2 concentrations, and monochromatic absorption coefficient-or equivalently soot-provide information about the flame structure and its dependence on the applied radiant flux.  Increasing the radiant flux causes an increase in the flame volume and consequently a widening of the spatial distribution of the flame structure, although the overall flame characteristics and maximum temperatures and concentration levels remain unchanged.},

	Abstract = {A numerical model of meterology, aerosols, and radiative transfer is used to study the impact of a large forest fire smoke plume on atmospheric processes.  The simulated smoke optical depths at 0.63-mu-m wavelength are in agreement with analyses of satellite data and show values as high as 1.8.  The smoke has an albedo of 35%, or more than double the clear-sky value, and cools the surface by as much as 5 K.  The best agreement with the analyses of optical depth and surface cooling is obtained when a fuel loading more than 10 times that which has been previously suggested is used to calculate the initial smoke mass load.  An imaginary refractive index, n(im), of 0.01 yields results which closely match the observed cooling, single scattering albedo, and the Angstrom wavelength exponent.  An n(im) of 0.1, typical of smoke from urban fires, produces 9 K cooling.  Coagulation causes the geometric mean radius by number to increase from the initial value of 0.08-mu-m to a final value of 0.15-mu-m while the specific extinction and absorption increase by 40% and 25%, respectively.  After 42 hours, these changes in the smoke optical properties lead to a 32% increase in optical depth and an 11% increase in surface cooling over that found in a simulation where coagulation is not allowed.  In the model, 47% of the smoke is removed by scavenging as it is incorporated into the frontal zone over the Great Lakes.  Self-lofting of the smoke in a direct, smoke-induced circulation is observed in the baseline simulation and is much stronger in the urban smoke simulation.},

The predicted growth of the fire is compared with the experimental data and in particular the predicted and measured times to 'flashover' are compared.  The comparisons show exceptional agreement which, in part, may be fortuitous due to the need to facilitate the prediction of the early stages of the growth with the aid of an experimentally estimated fire strength.  The good agreement nonetheless is also due to the full description of the radiation transfer which is a feature of the mathematical model.

Flame heights and characteristic residence times also were measured, both for the turbulent flames and at the normal smoke point (for the sooting fuels).  Carbon monoxide and soot generation factors (mass of CO or soot emitted per unit mass of fuel carbon burned) were uniform throughout the overfire region and were relatively independent of flame residence times (which were generally an order of magnitude longer than the normal smoke point residence times of the sooting fuels).  Processes of carbon monoxide and soot emission for the nonalcohols are closely related, based on the good correlation between their emission factors:  0.37 kg CO/per kg soot with a standard deviation of 0.09.  However, nonsooting methanol and ethanol/air flames still emitted low levels of CO so that there is a component of CO emissions that is not associated with soot.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were obtained from aircraft penetrations of controlled burns of chaparral, pine forest, and a JP-4 (jet fuel) pool fire. Vegetative burns gave rise to large numbers of CN, most of which were also CCN at a supersaturation of less than 1%. This is to be contrasted with the much lower activity of smoke from JP-4 bums which gave only 1-2% CCN activity under identical conditions. The field observations are consistent with laboratory results under conditions which simulate natural clouds. This implies that although droplets readily grow on smoke from vegetative burns leading to activation of a significant number of the particles, mutual competition ensures that a large number of interstitial haze particles remain. By contrast, in clouds produced from smoke from jet fuel combustion, a larger fraction of the nonactive interstitial particles remain after cloud formation. Penetrations of a forest fire capping cloud show high concentrations (> 10(4) cm-3) of small (2-mu-m diameter) but optically active particles together with high concentrations (5 x 10(5) cm-3) of nonactivated haze particles. Photogrammetric measurements of vertical velocities of clouds from controlled bums showed that weakly sheared plumes penetrated upward more effectively than strongly sheared plumes with cloud and smoke cap velocities as large as 20 m s-1. This implies vertical velocities twice this value and cloud supersaturations of approximately 2% under the observation conditions. Implications for particle removal by in-cloud scavenging and precipitation are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A buoyant, turbulent methane flame with a base diameter of 0.25 m and a heat release rate of 28 kW was numerically modeled.  Soot formation was included in the model by a phenomenological soot formation scheme.  Gas radiation was treated by a weighted-sum gray-gas model.  A non-isothermal, non-homogeneous field approach was utilized and the thermal radiation was included by incorporating a four flux radiation model into a finite-difference scheme.
The methane fire did not show appreciable soot concentrations to the extent that the radiation was significantly affected.  The radiation present was predominantly due to gaseous species.  The centerline flame properties such as the axial velocity, mean temperature, and entrainment behaviors are generally well reproduced by the theory.  However, the radial expansion of the flame is underestimated near the flame base because of the neglect of the elliptic behavior in the present approach.
An analysis of the thermal radiation behavior revealed a approach.
An analysis of the thermal radiation behavior revealed a non-uniform heat feedback flux distribution.  Unlike in sooting flames, where the flux maximizes usually midway between the centerline and flame edge, we observe the maximum flux at the pool center in the methane fire.  In sooting flames, this behavior arises because of radiative energy blockage by the cold fuel vapor and soot in the core.  A reduced radiation blockage in the methane flame is a distinguishing feature of the methane fire compared with sooting pool fires.},

@article{Hu2013,
	Abstract = {The work in this paper is to clarify and quantify experimentally the effect of cross air flow on flame radiation feedback to fuel surface in medium pool fires. Square pools with dimensions ranged in 10-25 cm are burnt under cross air flow speed ranged in 0-2.5 m/s, using ethanol and heptane as representative fuel producing flame of definitely different sootiness and luminosity as to compare their response to the cross air flow in radiation feedback. The incident radiation heat flux to the fuel surface is measured by a step-sum method using water-cooled radiation gauges on discrete regions of the surface, along with the fuel mass burning history recorded simultaneously by an electronic balance with resolution of 0.1 g. Results show that the cross airflow, by deflecting the flame, reduces the radiation feedback remarkably to finally approach a nearly stable lower value with increase in flow speed. Such reduction relative to that with no wind is quantified, as found to be more effective for heptane pool fire (50-70%) than that for ethanol pool fire (25-35%). However, at the same time, the burning rate is enhanced by the cross air flow. The two fractions, chi(a) (fraction of radiation heat absorbed by fuel surface to that needed for evaporation) and chi(s) (fraction of incident feedback radiation to total heat released by combustion), are then further quantified. They both decrease considerably with increase in flow speed. The chi(a) and chi(s) under no wind are shown to be quite different for heptane (range in 20-60% (chi(s)) and 0.5-1.5% (chi(s) ) increasing with pool size) and ethanol (nearly constant 25% (chi(a)) and 2% (chi(s)) independent of pool size). However, when subjected to a relative strong wind as Froude number (Fr) beyond 1, chi(a) is found to be similar for these two different fuels (in 5-15%), but chi(a) found in 0.4-1% for ethanol and in 0.1-0.5% for heptane. The behaviors of pool scale effect on both flame radiation feedback fraction (chi(a)), and accordingly mass burning flux, with a cross air flow are shown to be quite different from those without cross air flow. The flame radiation feedback fraction (chi(a)) increases with pool size and is much higher for heptane than that of ethanol at no cross air flow; while it is similar for these two fuels under a cross air flow and being much lower than that with no cross air flow. Accordingly, the mass burning flux increases with pool size at no cross air flow; while being similar at a relative higher value regardless of pool size for a given Fr with a cross air flow than that with no cross air flow (pool scale effect showing to be well converged by Fr when subjected to a relative strong cross air flow as Fr beyond the critical value of about 1). These quantifications and findings reveal that under a cross air flow, the relative importance of different heat feedback mechanism of a pool fire has been altered prominently due to the deflection of the flame. Flame radiation feedback declines remarkably while those from wall conduction and flame convection should be enhanced to be predominant, which is essential in re-considering the heat balance to characterize and especially to scale the burning behavior of a pool fire in cross air flows.

	Abstract = {This work focuses on the numerical modelling of radiative heat transfer in laboratory-scale buoyant turbulent diffusion flames. Spectral gas and soot radiation is modelled by using the Full-Spectrum Correlated-k (FSCK) method. Turbulence-Radiation Interactions (TRI) are taken into account by considering the Optically-Thin Fluctuation Approximation (OTFA), the resulting time-averaged Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) being solved by the Finite Volume Method (FVM). Emission TRIs and the mean absorption coefficient are then closed by using a presumed probability density function (pdf) of the mixture fraction. The mean gas flow field is modelled by the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes (FANS) equation set closed by a buoyancy-modified k-epsilon model with algebraic stress/flux models (ASM/AFM), the Steady Laminar Flamelet (SLF) model coupled with a presumed pdf approach to account for Turbulence-Chemistry Interactions, and an acetylene-based semi-empirical two-equation soot model. Two sets of experimental pool fire data are used for validation: propane pool fires 0.3 m in diameter with Heat Release Rates (HRR) of 15, 22 and 37 kW and methane pool fires 0.38 m in diameter with HRRs of 34 and 176 kW. Predicted flame structures, radiant fractions, and radiative heat fluxes on surrounding surfaces are found in satisfactory agreement with available experimental data across all the flames. In addition further computations indicate that, for the present flames, the gray approximation can be applied for soot with a minor influence on the results, resulting in a substantial gain in Computer Processing Unit (CPU) time when the FSCK is used to treat gas radiation.},

The calculations are compared with McCaffrey's (1979) experiments. The simulation results demonstrate good quantitative agreement with experimental measurements, and show the scaling relations of mean temperature and velocity in the continuous flame, intermittent and plume regions. The numerical simulations are shown to be strictly conservative in energy. Predicted flame heights and entrainment rates also compare well with experimental correlations. The good agreements in all aspects examined show that the current CFD model performs well for small-scale fire plumes.

	Abstract = {Flame heat transfer blockage occurs as fuel vapors, soot and products of combustion near a burning fuel surface block much of the heat feedbacks (including external radiative heat flux) to the fuel surface of a burning object. Blockage clearly affects burning rates and heat release rates of fires. This needs to be included when calculating flame heat transfer in fire growth models. An understanding of burning of materials in small scale fires is of broad and vital importance for predicting their burning performance in large scale fires. The blockage phenomenon was clearly observed and quantitatively measured in experiments that took advantage of the unique capability of the Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA) of being able to vary the ambient oxygen concentrations. An indirect measurement approach was established which provides an experimental understanding of the concept of the blockage. The measurements were further explained by a one-dimensional steady-state model of a diffusion flame, which focuses on the radiant absorption and emission by the gas-soot mixture of flames. The theoretical model provides a greater understanding of the fundamental knowledge of the blockage. The overall heat transfer blockage factor can be up to 0.3-0.4 for PMMA and POM. The factor and its components are nearly independent of the external radiation, but increase as the ambient oxygen concentration rises. A comparison between experimental data and model prediction shows a good agreement.},

The complex refractive index of the soot was deduced by the fixed-point iteration. The comparison of the complex refractive index between terahertz spectra domain and thermal radiation spectra domain was conducted and two method of extracting the parameters were also compared. The results indicated that the soot has strong absorption in the studied spectra and the difference in the refractive index between the two spectra domains was not obvious. but the absorptive index variation in the thermal radiation spectra domain was larger. The difference between the two parameter extraction methods was not significant. The deduced results can provide the optical data of soot. for the application of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy technique to the optical combustion diagnostics, and extend the optical combustion diagnostics application area.},

The spectra were recorded at a resolution of 0.112cm(-1) using a commercial Fourier transform spectrometer. The pressure of each benzene vapor sample was measured using high-precision capacitance manometers, and a minimum,1111 of nine sample pressures were recorded for each temperature. The samples were introduced into the temperature-stabilized static cell (19.94(l) cm pathlength) that was hard-mounted into the spectremeter. Front these data a fit composite Spectrum was calculated for each temperature. The number density for the three composite spectra was normalized to 296 K. The spectra give the absorption coefficient (cm(2) molecule(-1), naperian units) as a function of wavenumber. From these spectra integrated band intensities (cm molecule(-1) and atm(-1) cm(-2)) for intervals corresponding to the stronger benzene bands were calculated and were compared with previously reported values. We discuss and quantify error Sources and estimate Our systematic (NIST Type-B) errors to be 3% for the stronger bands. The measured absorption coefficients and integrated band intensities are useful for remote sensing applications such as measurements of planetary atmospheres and assessment of the environmental impact of terrestrial oil fire emissions.

Room-temperature measurements of neat hydrocarbon vapor were made with an instrument resolution of both 0.1 and 1cm(-1) (FWHM) to confirm that the high-resolution setting was required only to resolve the propene absorption spectrum while the spectra of the other hydrocarbons could be resolved with 1 cm(-1) resolution. High-resolution (0.1 cm(-1)), room-temperature measurements of neat hydrocarbons were made at low pressure (similar to 1 Torr, 13 3 Pa) and compared to measurements of hydrocarbon/N-2 mixtures at atmospheric pressure to verify that no pressure broadening could be observed over this pressure range. The temperature was varied between 25 and 500 degrees C for atmospheric-pressure measurements of hydrocarbon/N-2 mixtures (X-hydrocarbon similar to 0.06-1.5%) and it was found that the absorption cross section shows simple temperature-dependent behavior for a fixed wavelength over this temperature range. Comparisons with previous FTIR data over a limited temperature range and with high-resolution laser absorption data over a wide temperature range show good agreement. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Spectrally resolved infrared absorption coefficients of methanol were measured using high temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for a range of temperatures (up to 1000 K) expected to be within the fuel rich core of pool fires. Principal absorption band peaks decreased with increasing temperature. The spectral region of the dominant C--O stretching peak causes the integrated Planck mean absorption coefficient to decrease above 350 K. Unidirectional radiation intensity along the fire centerline for a 0.3 m diameter methanol pool was calculated using the 1-D radiative transport equation with the highly resolved absorption coefficient database of methanol and combustion products, and gas-phase temperature and species profiles calculated by NIST's Fire Dynamics Simulator. The spectrally integrated intensity at the methanol pool surface was calculated at 12,400 W/m2 sr, which agreed to within 2\% of previously reported unidirectional radiation intensity measurements. Intensity calculations with oft-used simplifications for modeling fuel vapor absorption were compared with the spectrally resolved, temperature-dependent absorption calculations, and errors with the simplified approaches for integrated radiation intensity to the pool surface were as high as 20\%. This study suggests that even for small methanol pool fires, gas-phase fuel absorption coefficients should have accurate assessments for calculating radiation heat transfer to the pool surface.},

	Abstract = {The narrow band model parameters of the carbon dioxide 4·3 $\mu$m band have been obtained from absorption experiments with four broadening gases, namely CO, N2, O2, and Ar. The temperature and wave number dependence of the parameters are discussed. The experiments were performed at temperatures of about 303, 598 and 1185$\,^{\circ}$K, with CO2 partial pressures between 0·01 and 1·0 atm, at a total pressure of 1·0 atm. The Elsasser and the statistical models were applied to thebands in order to obtain applicable parameters and to determine a suitable model for the band at each temperature. It has been found that the Elsasser model is an adequate representation of the band at low temperatures whereas the statistical model is preferred at elevated temperatures. The effect on the line half-widths of the broadening gases is discussed. Good agreement is obtained between absorptance calculated with the present parameters and experimental results obtained by other authors.},

@article{Matheson1932,
abstract = {An experimental method of measuring the absolute intensities of infrared absorption bands in gases has been used in which the absorbed energy was measured directly by the volume change in the absorbing gas due to the heat evolution in it. The absorption cell was traversed by radiation from a specially constructed infrared monochromator arranged for evacuation. The incident energy density was found through a calibrated thermocouple and galvanometer and the optical characteristics of the monochromator. Measurements were made with various path-lengths of absorbing gas. The absorption was extrapolated to zero by using a logarithmic graph which has many advantages. Line-width forms were investigated. It was found that for CO, $\alpha$=∫$\alpha$vdv was 1.18×1013 for the fundamental vibration band at 4.66$\mu$ and 1.54×1011 for the harmonic. The corresponding Einstein coefficients and the amplitudes of electric moment were calculated. The results of the analysis show that the Lorentz collision
broadening type of line shape satisfies the experimental data much better than other line shapes. The line widths of the fundamental and harmonic bands were observed as 0.10 and 0.12 cm-1 at atmospheric pressure which would arise from collision diameters of 5.5A and 6.1A respectively. These line widths are smaller than have been previously reported for infrared lines.},

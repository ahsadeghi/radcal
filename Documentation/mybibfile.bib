	abstract = {The spectral variation of the optical properties of soot particles is determined by combining classical and dynamic light scattering measurements with the Kramers-Kronig relations. Particle size and number densities are determined from scattering/extinction and autocorrelation measurements at the wavelength of 0.488 μ m. This information is then combined with the spectral extinction measurements in the wavelength range 0.2 to 6.4 μ m to determine the spectral variation of the refractive indices of flame soot. Results are presented for a premixed propane-oxygen flame with a fuel equivalence ratio φ = 1.8. The sensitivity of the technique and its advantage over the previous methods are discussed.},

Dispersion formulas are developed for interpolating the data between 0.8 and 2.5μ. The results are used to calculate the spectral absorption coefficient and the total emissivities of soot suspensions. It is shown that the correct values of the optical constants are needed in the use of light-scattering techniques for the measurement of the soot concentration but that uncertainties introduced in flux calculations by use of approximate values of the optical constants are not greater than those introduced by the present uncertainties in the values of the soot concentration.}},
